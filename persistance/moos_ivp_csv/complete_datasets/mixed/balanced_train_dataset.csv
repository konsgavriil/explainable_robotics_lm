In the given representation, the vehicle is currently in the ""in-transit"" behavior stage and heading towards waypoint 0.

In this scenario, it would be more appropriate to use the behavior combination Maxdepth,loiter,bhv_const_depth instead of Maxdepth,bhv_const_depth,waypt_survey. This is because the vehicle should be loitering around a predefined set of waypoints during the waiting period, rather than moving towards a specific survey point.
