Generate a causal explanation from the representation that indicates how the active behaviour of alpha is influenced by the rest of the vehicle states.
The active behaviour of alpha is influenced by the rest of the vehicle states in the following way: alpha is currently in the ""in-transit"" behaviour stage and has a very far obstacle named ""obstacle_a"" in the southeast direction. Despite the obstacle being very far away, alpha continues its course towards point 0, followed by points 1, 2, 3, and 4, before returning to the starting position at pointstart with maximum speed and a northwest heading. The active behaviour of alpha is influenced by the rest of the vehicle states in this way."

Gilda is currently loitering fast towards point 0 with a northwest heading. Gilda is actively avoiding obstacle 2, which is in close proximity, to prevent any potential collisions. Gilda's active behavior is influenced by the need to loiter and avoid obstacles while moving towards the loiter point at a fast speed. Additionally, the active behavior is also influenced by the objective of loitering in different areas while avoiding obstacles and collisions with other vessels."

Explanation: Henry is currently en route to point 6 in the northeast while in a loitering state. It is currently at the water's surface and has received a GPS update. The vessel is moving at an idle speed with a northeast heading and is actively maintaining its depth on the surface. As a result, the active behavior of Henry is influenced by its current state of being in a loitering state, at the water's surface, and with a northeast heading.

How does the active behavior of henry influence the rest of the vehicle states?
The active behavior of henry influences the rest of the vehicle states by causing it to loiter between points 0 to 7 until a survey objective is provided, then perform the survey and finally return back to starting point. The vehicle states are influenced by the active behavior to maintain a very deep depth, move at a fast speed in the northwest direction, and have a northeast heading.
What is the next waypoint for henry?

Gilda is currently loitering fast towards point 0 with a southwest heading, while actively avoiding obstacle 2, which is in the far proximity. Gilda's active behavior is influenced by the need to continue loitering and avoiding obstacles in order to fulfill its objective of loitering around in different areas. Additionally, the presence of obstacle 2 in the far proximity does not directly affect Gilda's current behavior."
