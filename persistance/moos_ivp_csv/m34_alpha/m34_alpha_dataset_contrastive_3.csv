Explanation: Gilda is currently in a state where it needs to avoid obstacles and collisions with other vessels. In this scenario, it is important for Gilda to prioritize obstacle avoidance, which is included in the active behavior 'avd_obstacles_avd_obstacles_ob_0', along with collision avoidance ('avdcol_henry'). By selecting the behavior 'loiter,avdcol_henry', Gilda is actively avoiding obstacles and collisions while loitering. 

If Gilda were to switch to the behavior 'Waypt_return,avd_obstacles_avd_obstacles_ob_0', it would prioritize returning to its starting point without actively avoiding obstacles anymore. This could potentially lead to a collision or other dangerous situations if there are obstacles in the vicinity. Therefore, it is not advisable to switch to 'Waypt_return,avd_obstacles_avd_obstacles_ob_0' in this scenario.

Explanation: The current behavior of Gilda, which is Loiter while avoiding obstacle 2, allows the vehicle to move around and explore different areas while ensuring the safety of the vehicle and avoiding collision with obstacle 2. 

Changing to the behavior of Station-keep would mean that Gilda would stay in one place without any movement, regardless of the presence of obstacle 2. This would limit the vehicle's ability to explore and navigate around obstacles, which might be necessary for completing its objective of loitering in different areas.
