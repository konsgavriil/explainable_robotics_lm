User Query: 
Why is alpha not returning to its starting point while avoiding the obstacle?

Explanations:
1) Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective, which includes reaching point 0 with a northeast heading and at a fast speed before returning. Avoiding the obstacle may not be the highest priority at the moment.
2) The obstacle resolution may require further analysis or action before alpha can safely return while avoiding the obstacle.
3) The vehicle may have a predefined route or sequence of actions that it needs to follow, prioritizing reaching point 0 before addressing the obstacle.

User Query: 
Why is alpha not avoiding obstacles while surveying the area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently surveying the area and does not have any obstacle in its path. It is programmed to avoid obstacles during the surveying behavior, but since there is currently no obstacle present, it does not need to exhibit the behavior of avoiding obstacles.

Why is alpha avoiding obstacle A instead of avoiding obstacle B?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently programmed to avoid obstacle A specifically. This behavior was chosen based on the proximity and characteristics of obstacle A. Obstacle B may have different characteristics, such as size or location, that make it more appropriate for Alpha to avoid using a different behavior. The choice of avoiding obstacle A over obstacle B is based on the specific situation and criteria set by the decision-making logic.

Explanation: 
Currently, there is no obstacle present in the vehicle's path, so there is no need for it to perform the ""avoid_obstacle"" behavior. The vehicle can continue surveying the area without any obstacles to avoid.

2) Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding multiple obstacles?

Explanation:
The current representation states that there are no obstacles present in the vehicle's path, so there is no need for it to perform the ""avoid_obstacle"" behavior multiple times. The vehicle can continue surveying the area without any obstacles to avoid.

3) Why is alpha not surveying the area at a slower speed?

Explanation:
The vehicle is currently set to survey the area at a fast speed, which allows it to cover more ground in less time. If the objective requires more detailed observations, the vehicle can be configured to survey at a slower speed to gather more comprehensive data.

   - Explanation 1: The obstacle name is currently set to ""none"", indicating that there is no obstacle present in the vehicle's path. Therefore, there is no need for alpha to activate the ""avoid_obstacle"" behavior.
   - Explanation 2: Alpha is currently not detecting any obstacles in its vicinity, as the obstacle proximity is set to ""none"". Hence, there is no need for alpha to activate the ""avoid_obstacle"" behavior.
   - Explanation 3: The vehicle's behavior is set to ""waypt_survey"" which focuses on surveying the area, not specifically avoiding obstacles. As there are no obstacles present, there is no need for alpha to exhibit the ""avoid_obstacle"" behavior.

2) Query: Why is alpha not moving at a slower speed while surveying the area?
   - Explanation 1: The current objective given to alpha is to move at a ""very fast"" speed, which might be necessary to cover a larger area in a shorter time. Therefore, alpha does not exhibit a slower speed when surveying the area.
   - Explanation 2: The speed of the vehicle is determined by the requirements of the mission. If there are time constraints or the need to cover a large area quickly, alpha might need to move at a faster speed while surveying.
   - Explanation 3: The decision to move at a slower speed depends on the specific scenario and mission requirements. If there is no specific need to slow down, alpha might continue surveying at its current speed.

3) Query: Why is alpha not activating the ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_d"" behavior instead of the current behavior?
   - Explanation 1: The current obstacle direction is set to ""none"", indicating that there is no obstacle present. The ""avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_d"" behavior is designed to avoid obstacles in a specific direction, so if there is no obstacle present, there is no need for alpha to activate this behavior.
   - Explanation 2: The current behavior combination of ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a"" might have been determined based on the specific obstacles present in the environment. If the obstacles in the scenario don't align with the conditions for activating ""avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_d"", alpha might not exhibit this behavior.
   - Explanation 3: The decision to activate a specific behavior combination depends on the analysis of the environment and the potential obstacles. If the current behavior combination is deemed sufficient to handle the known obstacles, there might be no need for alpha to activate ""avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_d"".

1) Explanation for query 1:
The reason alpha is not avoiding obstacles while surveying the area is that there are currently no obstacles in its path. The obstacle_name is set to ""none"", which indicates that there are no obstacles present. Therefore, there is no need for alpha to exhibit the behavior of avoiding obstacles while surveying.

2) Explanation for query 2:
Alpha is not returning to its starting point while avoiding obstacles because there are currently no obstacles in its path. The obstacle_name is set to ""none"", indicating that there are no obstacles present. Thus, there is no need for alpha to exhibit the behavior of avoiding obstacles while returning.

3) Explanation for query 3:
Alpha is not surveying the area while avoiding obstacle A because obstacle_name is not equal to ""A"". Hence, there is no need for alpha to exhibit the behavior of avoiding obstacle A while surveying. The current obstacle in its path might be a different obstacle or no obstacle at all.

4) Explanation for query 4:
Alpha is not surveying the area while avoiding obstacles B and E because the active_behaviour is set to ""waypt_survey"" only. The available behavior that includes avoiding obstacles B and E is ""Waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_b,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e"". This behavior combination is not currently active for alpha, so it is not exhibiting the behavior of avoiding obstacles B and E while surveying.

5) Explanation for query 5:
Alpha is not surveying the area while avoiding obstacles C and E because the active_behaviour is set to ""waypt_survey"" only. The available behavior that includes avoiding obstacles C and E is ""Waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_c,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e"". This behavior combination is not currently active for alpha, so it is not exhibiting the behavior of avoiding obstacles C and E while surveying.

Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding an obstacle instead of just surveying the area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective, which is to move towards point 1 with a southeast heading and at maximum speed. Since there is no obstacle in its path, there is no need for the vehicle to activate the behavior of avoiding an obstacle while surveying. However, if there was an obstacle present, alpha could activate the behavior of avoiding an obstacle in order to fulfill its objective while ensuring safety.

Why is alpha not idle with no activated behavior instead of surveying the area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently deployed and has a defined objective to move towards point 1. If alpha was idle with no activated behavior, it would not be able to fulfill its objective. Surveying the area allows alpha to gather data or perform the necessary tasks at the designated waypoints. Therefore, it is more appropriate for alpha to be surveying the area instead of being idle.

Explanation: Alpha is currently deployed and its objective is to go to points 0, 1, 2 and then return to the starting position. The behavior ""none"" represents an idle state with no activated behavior, which is not suitable for achieving the objective. The behavior ""waypt_survey"" allows alpha to survey the area and gather necessary information before returning, aiding in achieving the objective more effectively.

2) Why is alpha not using the behavior ""waypt_return"" instead of surveying an area?

Explanation: Alpha is currently in the process of going to point 2 as part of its objective. The behavior ""waypt_return"" is specifically designed for alpha to return to its starting position. However, since alpha has not completed its objective of reaching point 2 yet, activating the ""waypt_return"" behavior at this point would disrupt the planned sequence of points and prevent alpha from completing its task.

3) Why is alpha not using the behavior ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a"" instead of surveying an area?

Explanation: Alpha is currently surveying the area without encountering any obstacles. The behavior ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a"" is specifically designed for alpha to survey the area while avoiding a specific type of obstacle named ""avoid_obstacle_a"". Since there are no obstacles detected or resolved at the moment, there is no need for alpha to activate this specific behavior.

4) Why is alpha not using the behavior ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_b"" instead of surveying an area?

Explanation: Alpha is currently surveying the area without encountering any obstacles. The behavior ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_b"" is specifically designed for alpha to survey the area while avoiding a different type of obstacle named ""avoid_obstacle_b"". Since there are no obstacles detected or resolved at the moment, there is no need for alpha to activate this specific behavior.

5) Why is alpha not using the behavior ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_c,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e"" instead of surveying an area?

Explanation: Alpha is currently surveying the area without encountering any obstacles. The behavior ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_c,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e"" is designed for alpha to survey the area while avoiding two specific types of obstacles named ""avoid_obstacle_c"" and ""avoid_obstacle_e"".

Explanation: Alpha is currently in the ""waypt_survey"" behavior, which means it is actively surveying points 0, 1, and 2. Avoiding an obstacle is only necessary when an obstacle is detected and needs to be resolved. Since there is no obstacle present in this representation, there is no need for alpha to switch to the ""avoid_obstacle"" behavior.

2) Why is alpha not returning to its starting point while avoiding the obstacle instead of surveying the area?
Explanation: Alpha is currently in the ""waypt_survey"" behavior, which means its objective is to survey points 0, 1, and 2. Returning to the starting point while avoiding an obstacle is only necessary when both the deploy and return flags are set to true, and an obstacle is detected. In this representation, the return flag is set to false, indicating that alpha does not need to return to the starting point yet.

3) Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding obstacle_a instead of surveying the area without avoiding any obstacles?
Explanation: Alpha is currently in the ""waypt_survey"" behavior, which means its objective is to survey points 0, 1, and 2. The presence of obstacle_a and the need to avoid it is determined by the obstacle_name variable. In this representation, the obstacle_name is set to ""none"", indicating that there is no specific obstacle to avoid. Therefore, there is no need for alpha to switch to the ""avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a"" behavior.

4) Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding obstacles b and c instead of surveying the area without avoiding any obstacles?
Explanation: Alpha is currently in the ""waypt_survey"" behavior, which means its objective is to survey points 0, 1, and 2. The presence of obstacles b and c and the need to avoid them is determined by the obstacle_name variable. In this representation, the obstacle_name is set to ""none"", indicating that there are no specific obstacles to avoid.

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently surveying an area to fulfill its objective of going to points 0, 1, and 2. The presence of obstacle_b is not affecting its path towards these points, so there is no need for alpha to change its behavior and start avoiding obstacle_b.

2) Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding obstacle_c instead of surveying an area without avoiding any obstacles?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently surveying the area without avoiding any obstacles because obstacle_c is not present or it has already been resolved. There is no need for alpha to engage in the avoid_obstacle behavior if there are no obstacles in its path.

3) Why is alpha not returning to its starting point while avoiding obstacle_a instead of surveying an area while avoiding obstacle_a?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently surveying the area while avoiding obstacle_a because it has not yet completed its objective of going to points 0, 1, and 2. If alpha were to return to its starting point while avoiding obstacle_a, it would not be able to fulfill its objective. Therefore, alpha's current behavior is more aligned with its objective.

4) Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding obstacle_e instead of surveying the area without avoiding any obstacles?

Alpha is currently surveying the area with a northwest heading and at a very fast speed. It is not avoiding obstacles C and E because these obstacles are not present in its current environment. The vehicle has determined that there is no need to change its behavior to avoid these non-existent obstacles.

Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle_b instead of obstacle_a?

Explanation: 
Obstacle_a is currently the obstacle in the path of alpha, so it is actively avoiding it. The active behavior 'avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a' represents this action. If there was another obstacle, obstacle_b, in a different direction or with a different proximity, alpha could potentially prioritize avoiding it instead. However, since obstacle_a is the closest obstacle and has not been resolved, alpha continues to avoid it.

User Query: 
Why is alpha not idle instead of surveying an area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently deployed and has an objective to go to points 0, 1, and 2. Therefore, it is not in an idle state. If the deploy flag was set to false, alpha would be idle. However, in the current representation, since alpha is actively deployed, it is not in an idle state.

Why is alpha not returning to its starting point and avoiding obstacles instead of only surveying an area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently in the middle of its objective, which is to go to points 0, 1, and 2. It has not reached its final destination or received a command to return, so it continues to survey the area. If alpha encounters an obstacle while surveying, it will actively avoid it, but it will not alter its objective of surveying the area unless specifically instructed to return to the starting point.

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently programmed to avoid obstacle_a, which is in close proximity to the vehicle. The decision to avoid obstacle_a instead of obstacle_b could be due to the fact that obstacle_a poses a higher risk or is closer in distance compared to obstacle_b.

User Query: Why is alpha not idle instead of surveying an area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently deployed and has a specific objective to go to points 0, 1, 2, and then return to the starting position. Being idle would not fulfill its objective or serve any purpose. The active behavior of surveying the area allows the vehicle to gather data or perform necessary tasks while on its mission.

User Query: Why is alpha not returning to its starting point while avoiding an obstacle?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently surveying the area and avoiding obstacle_a. The decision to not return to the starting point while avoiding the obstacle could be due to the priority given to completing the objective of surveying the area. Returning to the starting point might interrupt or delay the data collection process. The vehicle's decision-making logic prioritizes completing the objective before addressing obstacles on the return route.

User Query: Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding multiple obstacles?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently programmed to avoid only one obstacle, obstacle_a. This could be due to the limited capacity or capability of the vehicle to handle multiple obstacles simultaneously. The decision-making logic might prioritize avoiding the most immediate or dangerous obstacle first and deal with other obstacles sequentially. Surveying the area while avoiding multiple obstacles would require more advanced obstacle avoidance algorithms or higher computational resources.

User Query: Why is alpha not surveying the area at a slower speed?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently programmed to survey the area at a very fast speed. The decision to choose a very fast speed could be based on factors such as efficiency, mission requirements, or time constraints. Slowing down the speed might reduce the coverage area or increase the time required to complete the survey. The vehicle's decision-making logic prioritizes accomplishing the mission efficiently without compromising the quality of data collection.

Explanation:
Alpha is currently surveying the area and avoiding obstacle_a because it is in the process of completing its objective. Its objective is to go to points 0, 1, 2, and then return to the starting position. However, since it has encountered obstacle_a, Alpha has activated the ""avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a"" behavior to navigate around the obstacle and continue with its surveying. Once obstacle_a is resolved or Alpha receives a command from C2, it will resume its objective of returning to the starting point.

2) Query: Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle_a and instead surveying the area?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently surveying the area because its objective is to go to points 0, 1, 2, and then return to the starting position. However, since it has encountered obstacle_a and the obstacle has not been resolved yet, Alpha has activated the ""waypt_survey"" behavior to continue surveying the area while simultaneously avoiding obstacle_a. This behavior allows Alpha to gather data while navigating around the obstacle. Once obstacle_a is resolved or Alpha receives a command from C2, it will resume its objective of returning to the starting point.

3) Query: Why is alpha avoiding obstacle_a instead of avoiding obstacle_b or obstacle_c while surveying the area?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently surveying the area and avoiding obstacle_a because it has encountered obstacle_a on its path. The decision to avoid obstacle_a instead of obstacle_b or obstacle_c depends on the proximity and location of the obstacles. If obstacle_a is the closest obstacle or poses the most immediate threat, Alpha will prioritize avoiding obstacle_a first. The order in which the obstacles are avoided can be defined in the prioritization logic of the autonomous vehicle's decision-making system. Once obstacle_a is resolved, if obstacle_b or obstacle_c is still present, Alpha will activate the corresponding avoidance behavior for the remaining obstacles.

Why is alpha surveying the area instead of returning to its starting point when obstacle a is close and not resolved?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective, which is to go to points 0, 1, 2 and then return to its starting position. However, there is an obstacle named obstacle_a that is currently close and not resolved. Therefore, the active behavior of alpha is to survey the area while avoiding this obstacle. This behavior ensures that alpha can continue its objective while safely navigating around the obstacle.

Alternative Explanations:

1) The obstacle may pose a significant threat to alpha's safety, warranting the need to survey the area thoroughly and ensure that the obstacle is avoided before proceeding towards the starting point. This cautious approach prioritizes the vehicle's safety and prevents any potential collisions.

2) Surveying the area allows alpha to gather more information about the obstacle's exact location, size, and characteristics. This information can be valuable for devising a more effective and efficient path for returning to the starting point while avoiding the obstacle. By surveying the area, alpha can make informed decisions and adjust its route accordingly.

3) Returning to the starting point immediately when an obstacle is close and not resolved could potentially lead to a collision or other safety risks. By surveying the area, alpha can assess the obstacle's conditions in real-time and determine the best course of action to avoid it effectively. This proactive approach ensures a safer navigation for the vehicle.

User Query: 
Why is alpha not performing any behavior when it is idle and there are no obstacles?

Explanation:
When alpha is in an idle state and there are no obstacles present, it means that the vehicle is currently not deployed and not assigned any specific objective. Therefore, there is no need for alpha to exhibit any active behaviors during this time. The absence of behavior during the idle state is intentional, as it allows the vehicle to conserve energy and remain in a standby mode until it receives further instructions or deployment.

Alternative Explanations:

1) The idle state allows alpha to minimize its power consumption and conserve its resources. By not exhibiting any active behaviors, alpha can reduce unnecessary energy usage, which is especially important in autonomous vehicles that rely on limited energy sources.

2) When there are no assigned objectives and no obstacles, maintaining an idle state allows alpha to be ready and available for any future tasks or deployments that may arise. This state ensures that alpha can quickly adapt and respond to new instructions or scenarios without being engaged in unnecessary activities that could hinder its readiness.

3) The absence of active behaviors during the idle state helps alpha avoid any potential misinterpretations or accidental actions. By remaining idle, alpha reduces the chance of unintentionally engaging in behaviors that may not be suitable or necessary in the absence of specific objectives or obstacles.

Why is alpha not avoiding the obstacle and surveying the area instead?

Explanations:
1) Alpha is currently in transit towards point 2 with a northwest heading and at a very fast speed. Since the obstacle proximity is close and it is not resolved yet, alpha should prioritize avoiding the obstacle. However, alpha may not have the capability to detect or avoid obstacles, or there may be a higher priority to complete the survey of the area.
2) Alpha may have a specific surveying task that needs to be completed urgently, and the obstacle can be addressed later. The priority of completing the survey may be determined by the importance of the collected data or the time sensitivity of the task.
3) Alpha may not have received any commands or updates regarding the obstacle, and it continues with its default behavior of surveying the area. Without real-time communication or advanced obstacle detection systems, alpha may not be able to adjust its behavior dynamically.

Why is alpha not avoiding the obstacle and surveying the area instead?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently surveying the area and has encountered an obstacle named ""obstacle_a"" in the southeast direction. The proximity of the obstacle is ""nearby"". Although alpha could potentially avoid the obstacle and continue surveying, it might have determined that the obstacle is not a significant threat and can be safely bypassed. Additionally, avoiding the obstacle might require significant deviation from its current path, which could hinder the completion of its objective.

Why is alpha not returning to its starting point and avoiding the obstacle at the same time?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective, which is to go to points 0, 1, and 2. It has encountered an obstacle named ""obstacle_a"" in the southeast direction, with a proximity of ""nearby"". While returning to the starting point is one of the available behaviors, alpha might have determined that avoiding the obstacle and continuing the survey would be more efficient in terms of time and resources. Additionally, returning to the starting point might not be feasible in the presence of the obstacle.

Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle_a and obstacle_e simultaneously while surveying?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently surveying the area and has encountered two obstacles: ""obstacle_a"" and ""obstacle_e"". While avoiding both obstacles simultaneously is possible, alpha might have determined that the complexity and potential risks associated with avoiding multiple obstacles at the same time outweigh the benefits. It could be more efficient for alpha to prioritize avoiding one obstacle at a time and continue its surveying objective.

Why is alpha not avoiding the obstacle and returning to its starting point?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective, specifically moving towards point 2 with a northwest heading and at a very fast speed. It has encountered an obstacle named ""obstacle_a"" in the southeast direction, with a proximity of ""nearby"". The primary objective of alpha is to complete its surveying task, and returning to the starting point might not be its top priority at the moment. Additionally, alpha might have determined that avoiding the obstacle and completing the surveying objective is still feasible without compromising safety.

Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle_c instead of surveying the area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective, specifically moving towards point 2 with a northwest heading and at a very fast speed. It has encountered an obstacle named ""obstacle_c"" in an unknown direction, with a proximity of ""none"". As there is no information regarding the location or threat level of the obstacle, alpha might have determined that it is not necessary to avoid the obstacle at this moment. Additionally, continuing the surveying task might be more time-sensitive or crucial compared to avoiding the obstacle.

Alpha is currently in the process of returning to its starting point, as indicated by the ""return"" value being true. However, it is not actively avoiding obstacle_a. This may be because obstacle_a has not been resolved yet or it is not in close proximity to the vehicle.

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently in the behavior stage of returning to its starting point due to the ""return"" attribute being set to True. This behavior is activated because the vehicle has completed its objective of reaching points 0, 1, and 2. Additionally, there is an obstacle present (obstacle_a) that is located far away from the vehicle. Since the obstacle is far and has not been resolved, the vehicle prioritizes returning to its starting point instead of surveying the area and avoiding the obstacle.

Potential Alternatives:
1) Waypt_return, avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a: In this behavior permutation, alpha could simultaneously return to its starting point while actively avoiding obstacle_a. This would allow the vehicle to complete its objective and avoid the obstacle.
2) Waypt_return, avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_b: Another alternative is for alpha to return to its starting point while actively avoiding another obstacle (obstacle_b) instead of obstacle_a. This could be a feasible option if obstacle_b is closer or poses a higher risk than obstacle_a.
3) Waypt_survey, avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a: Instead of returning to its starting point, alpha could switch to a behavior where it surveys the area while actively avoiding obstacle_a. This would allow the vehicle to continue its objective while ensuring safety by avoiding the obstacle.

Explanation: Alpha is currently in the behavior stage of returning to its starting point with a northwest heading and at maximum speed. The decision to return instead of surveying the area and avoiding obstacle A is based on the objective provided, which states that Alpha needs to go to points 0, 1, 2, and then return to the starting position. Returning to the starting point takes priority over other behaviors until the objective is completed or a command is received from C2.

Alternative 1: 

Behavior: waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a

Explanation: Instead of immediately returning to the starting point, Alpha could survey the area while also avoiding obstacle A. This behavior would allow Alpha to gather more data while ensuring that it navigates around the obstacle to avoid any potential collision.

Alternative 2:

Behavior: waypt_survey

Explanation: If the objective is not time-sensitive or there is no immediate need to return to the starting point, Alpha could continue surveying the area without considering the presence of obstacle A. This behavior would prioritize data collection over obstacle avoidance, which may be acceptable depending on the situation.

Alternative 3:

Behavior: waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_b

Explanation: Instead of avoiding obstacle A, Alpha could employ a different obstacle avoidance strategy, such as avoiding obstacle B. This behavior permutation would involve surveying the area while actively avoiding a different obstacle, allowing Alpha to collect data while ensuring safe navigation.

Explanation 1:
The vehicle is currently idle because it is not needed for any specific task or objective. This could be due to the completion of its previous objective or because it has not received any new commands from the control system. Deploying the vehicle to survey an area without a specific objective would be a wasteful use of resources and energy.

Explanation 2:
The vehicle may not have the necessary sensors or equipment to effectively survey an area. If the vehicle is not equipped with the required instruments or cameras, it would not be able to collect any meaningful data during the survey.

2) Why not deploy the vehicle to survey an area and avoid obstacles instead of returning to its starting point while avoiding an obstacle?

Explanation 1:
Returning to the starting point while avoiding an obstacle takes priority over surveying an area and avoiding obstacles. This behavior ensures the safety of the vehicle and prevents any potential damage or collisions with the obstacle. The control system prioritizes obstacle avoidance to minimize risks and protect the vehicle and its surroundings.

Explanation 2:
There may be specific instructions or protocols in place for the vehicle to return to its starting point in case of encountering an obstacle. Returning to the starting point could be a predetermined protocol to assess the situation, gather more information, or receive further instructions before continuing with the survey or any other task.

Explanation 3:
Returning to the starting point instead of surveying an area allows the vehicle to conserve its resources, such as battery power or fuel. By returning to the starting point, the vehicle can be recharged or refueled if needed before resuming its mission. This approach prioritizes maintaining the vehicle's operational capabilities and extends its mission endurance.

3) Why not deploy the vehicle to survey an area and avoid obstacles using a different obstacle avoidance pattern?

Explanation 1:
The specific obstacle avoidance pattern being used (avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a) might be the most appropriate and effective for the given environment and obstacles. Different patterns may have different strengths and weaknesses, and the current pattern might be selected based on factors such as obstacle types, vehicle capabilities, or previous successful implementations.

Explanation 2:
Implementing a different obstacle avoidance pattern could introduce unnecessary complexity and potential risks. The current pattern has been tested, verified, and proven to be reliable in ensuring obstacle avoidance without compromising the primary objective of surveying the area. Changing the pattern without a compelling reason could introduce uncertainties and potential vulnerabilities.

Explanation 3:
The control system might have determined that the current obstacle avoidance pattern provides the optimal balance between safety and efficiency. While other patterns may exist, they might not offer significant advantages or improvements compared to the current pattern. The control system aims to minimize unnecessary changes and maximize the overall effectiveness of the vehicle's behavior.

1) Why is alpha not deploying to survey the area instead of being idle?
    Explanation:
    - Alpha is currently idle because the ""deploy"" variable is set to false. This means that there is no activated behavior for alpha.
    - The potential alternative is for alpha to deploy and start surveying the area. This can be done by setting the ""deploy"" variable to true.

2) Why is alpha not returning to its starting point instead of being idle?
    Explanation:
    - Alpha is currently idle because both the ""deploy"" and ""return"" variables are set to false. This means that alpha is neither surveying nor returning.
    - The potential alternative is for alpha to return to its starting point. This can be done by setting the ""return"" variable to true while keeping the ""deploy"" variable as false.

3) Why is alpha not surveying the area and avoiding an obstacle instead of being idle?
    Explanation:
    - Alpha is currently idle because the ""deploy"" variable is set to false. This means that there is no activated behavior for alpha.
    - The potential alternative is for alpha to deploy and start surveying the area while avoiding an obstacle. This can be done by setting the ""deploy"" variable to true and including the behavior ""avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a"" or any other suitable avoidance behavior.

4) Why is alpha not surveying the area and avoiding an obstacle instead of surveying the area without obstacle avoidance?
    Explanation:
    - Alpha is currently surveying the area without obstacle avoidance because the ""deploy"" variable is true, the ""return"" variable is false, and there is no obstacle present.
    - The potential alternative is for alpha to survey the area while actively avoiding an obstacle. This can be done by including the behavior ""avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a"" or any other suitable avoidance behavior.

5) Why is alpha not surveying the area and avoiding multiple obstacles instead of surveying the area while avoiding only one obstacle?
    Explanation:
    - Alpha is currently surveying the area while avoiding one obstacle because the ""deploy"" variable is true, the ""return"" variable is false, there is an obstacle present, and it is not resolved.
    - The potential alternative is for alpha to survey the area while actively avoiding multiple obstacles. This can be done by including additional avoidance behaviors such as ""avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_b"", ""avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_c"", ""avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e"", or any suitable combination.

Explanation 1: Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective of moving towards point 0 with a southeast heading and at an idle speed. Since there is no obstacle present and the obstacle proximity is none, there is no need for alpha to engage in obstacle avoidance behavior. Therefore, alpha is only surveying the area.

Explanation 2: Alpha may not have the capability to detect obstacles or may not have received information about any obstacles in its current vicinity. Without the knowledge of an obstacle, alpha cannot activate the behavior of surveying the area while avoiding an obstacle.

Explanation 3: Alpha's current objective is to survey the area and it is not designed to prioritize obstacle avoidance. The decision-making logic of alpha might prioritize completing the surveying task efficiently rather than dedicating resources to obstacle avoidance.

User Query 2: Why is alpha not deploying and surveying the area while avoiding an obstacle instead of being idle?

Explanation 1: Alpha is currently not deployed because the deploy flag is set to false. This means that alpha is not required to perform any tasks or objectives at the moment and can remain idle until it receives further instructions from the control system.

Explanation 2: Alpha might not have received any commands or objectives from the control system to deploy and start surveying the area. It is waiting for instructions to activate its surveying behavior.

Explanation 3: Alpha might be experiencing a technical issue or malfunction that is preventing it from deploying and performing any tasks. In such cases, it goes into an idle state until the issue is resolved or it receives instructions to resume its operations.

User Query 3: Why is alpha not returning to its starting point while avoiding an obstacle instead of surveying the area?

Explanation 1: Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective of moving towards point 0 with a southeast heading and at an idle speed. Since the return flag is set to false, alpha is not supposed to return to its starting point at the moment. It will continue its surveying task until instructed otherwise.

Explanation 2: There may not be any obstacles present or any obstacle information provided to alpha that would require it to engage in obstacle avoidance behavior while returning to its starting point. Therefore, alpha continues surveying the area instead of returning.

Explanation 3: Alpha might be programmed to prioritize completing its surveying objective over returning to its starting point. It follows its trajectory and completes the survey until a different behavior is triggered or commanded by the control system.

1) Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding an obstacle instead of just surveying the area?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently deployed to survey the area and move towards point 1 with a southwest heading and at a very fast speed. Since there is no obstacle present, there is no need for Alpha to engage in obstacle avoidance behavior. The behavior of just surveying the area allows Alpha to efficiently complete its objective without any unnecessary detours or delays.

2) Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding multiple obstacles instead of just surveying the area?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently deployed to survey the area and move towards point 1 with a southwest heading and at a very fast speed. At the moment, there is only one obstacle present and it has not been resolved yet. Engaging in multiple obstacle avoidance behaviors would create complexity and introduce potential risks. Therefore, it is more efficient for Alpha to focus on surveying the area first and then deal with obstacles one at a time.

3) Why is alpha not returning to its starting point while avoiding an obstacle instead of just returning to its starting point?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently deployed to return to its starting point. Since there is no obstacle present, there is no need for Alpha to engage in obstacle avoidance behavior. By directly returning to its starting point, Alpha can complete its objective efficiently and without any unnecessary diversions or delays.

Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle_c instead of surveying the area?

Explanation 1:
Alpha is currently surveying the area and moving towards point 1, which is in the southwest direction. It is not avoiding obstacle_c because the vehicle is already on a path to reach its objective, and the obstacle is not in its immediate proximity. Once the vehicle comes closer to the obstacle_c, it can activate the behavior to avoid_obstacle to change its path and avoid the obstacle.

Explanation 2:
The active behavior of alpha is waypt_survey, which means its primary objective is to survey the area and reach point 1. Since the obstacle_c is not in the immediate vicinity of the vehicle, it continues with its surveying behavior. If the vehicle detects the obstacle in its nearby proximity, it can switch to the behavior avoid_obstacle to circumvent the obstacle and continue its surveying objective.

Explanation 3:
Alpha's active behavior is waypt_survey, which focuses on surveying the area and moving towards the next point. Obstacle_c, although present, does not immediately hinder the vehicle's path to its objective. Only when the obstacle_c comes nearby, the behavior avoid_obstacle should be activated to ensure the vehicle's safe navigation.

Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle_a instead of obstacle_c while surveying the area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently deployed to survey the area and avoid obstacle_c. The decision to avoid obstacle_c instead of obstacle_a is based on the proximity and direction of the obstacles. The vehicle's next point is towards the southeast, and obstacle_c is located in the southeast direction compared to obstacle_a. Hence, obstacle_c is considered a higher priority obstacle to avoid.

User Query: 
Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle_e as well as obstacle_c while surveying the area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently deployed to survey the area and avoid obstacle_c. While both obstacle_c and obstacle_e are present, the vehicle's decision-making logic prioritizes avoiding obstacle_c based on its proximity and direction. Obstacle_c is closer to the vehicle's current position and has a higher priority for avoidance.

Why is alpha not returning to its starting point while avoiding the nearby obstacle?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently deployed to survey the area and avoid the nearby obstacle. The vehicle's current objective is to survey the area, and it will only initiate the return to its starting point once the objective is complete or a command is received. Therefore, the vehicle is prioritizing the objective of surveying over returning to the starting point.

Why is alpha not avoiding any obstacles while surveying the area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently deployed to survey the area without avoiding any obstacles. This behavior may be chosen if the obstacle is determined to be far away or not a hindrance to the vehicle's surveying objective. It is possible that the obstacle does not pose a threat or obstruction to the vehicle's path, allowing it to continue surveying without the need for obstacle avoidance.

Explanation:
Alpha is currently deployed to survey the area and is encountering obstacle_c, which is in its path. The decision to avoid obstacle_c instead of obstacle_b is based on the proximity and the direction of the obstacles. Obstacle_c is closer to Alpha and is in the southeast direction, which is why it prioritizes avoiding it.

Potential Alternatives:
1) Alpha could prioritize avoiding obstacle_b instead of obstacle_c if obstacle_b is determined to be a higher priority obstacle or if it is closer in proximity to Alpha.
2) Alpha could dynamically adjust its path in a way that avoids both obstacles, obstacle_c and obstacle_b, if it is feasible and ensures the completion of its objective.
3) Alpha could consider the overall terrain and adjust its behavior to avoid both obstacle_c and obstacle_b simultaneously, ensuring a more optimal and efficient path.

Explanation:
When alpha is surveying the area, it is currently encountering obstacle_c, which is very close in proximity and has not been resolved yet. The decision-making logic dictates that alpha should prioritize avoiding obstacle_c over obstacle_a based on the order of avoidance behaviors specified. Since obstacle_c is very close and obstacle_a is not mentioned in the representation, alpha is currently not avoiding obstacle_a.

User Query: Why is alpha not returning to its starting point while avoiding obstacle_a?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently deployed to survey the area and encounters obstacle_a. However, the decision-making logic dictates that alpha should prioritize avoiding obstacle_a over returning to its starting point. Therefore, alpha uses the avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a behavior instead of the waypt_return behavior.

User Query: Why is alpha not returning to its starting point when the obstacle is very close?

Explanation:
Even though the obstacle is very close in proximity, alpha is still in the process of surveying the area. The decision-making logic prioritizes completing the objective before returning to the starting point. Therefore, alpha continues surveying the area instead of immediately returning.

Behavior Permutation:
No behavior permutation needed in this case.

User Query: Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding both obstacle_c and obstacle_e?

Explanation:
Currently, alpha is only equipped to avoid obstacle_c while surveying the area. The decision-making logic dictates that alpha should prioritize obstacle_c avoidance behavior over obstacle_e avoidance behavior. Therefore, alpha is not surveying the area while avoiding obstacle_e.

Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle_a instead of avoiding obstacle_c while surveying the area?

Explanation:
Alpha has encountered obstacle_c, which is very close to its current position in the southeast direction. To avoid this obstacle, it is currently executing the behavior ""avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_c"" while continuing its surveying task. The decision to avoid obstacle_c instead of obstacle_a could be based on various factors, such as obstacle priority, obstacle size, or obstacle location. 

Potential Alternatives:
1) Avoid Obstacle A: Alpha could have been programmed to prioritize avoiding obstacle_a over obstacle_c while surveying. This alternative would require a different set of behavior rules and decision-making logic to be implemented.
2) Avoid Both Obstacles: Alpha could have been programmed to avoid both obstacle_a and obstacle_c simultaneously while surveying. This alternative would require the implementation of a behavior that combines the avoidance strategies for multiple obstacles.
3) Ignore Obstacles: Alpha could have been programmed to continue its surveying task without actively avoiding any obstacles. This alternative assumes that obstacle avoidance is not crucial for the mission or that there is an alternative mechanism to handle potential collisions.

Instead of avoiding the obstacle and returning to its starting point, alpha is continuing with its survey as it may have been programmed to prioritize completing its objective over obstacle avoidance.

2) Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle_c and deploying behavior waypt_return instead of surveying the area?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently deployed to survey the area and is on its way to point 1 with a southeast heading and at a very fast speed. Despite detecting an obstacle_c nearby in the northeast direction, alpha is not deploying the behavior of avoiding the obstacle and returning to its starting point. This decision could be due to the fact that obstacle avoidance behaviors are not included in the current active behavior and alpha may not be programmed to prioritize obstacle avoidance when surveying.

3) Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle_c and deploying behavior waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_c instead of the current behavior?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently deployed to survey the area and is on its way to point 1 with a southeast heading and at a very fast speed. While it has detected an obstacle_c nearby in the northeast direction, alpha is not deploying the behavior of avoiding the obstacle_c with the corresponding behavior of waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_c. This could be because alpha may not have been programmed to activate the specific behavior combination for obstacle avoidance in this particular situation.

Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective of surveying points 0, 1, 2, and 3 with a southeast heading and at a very fast speed. It is currently on its way to point 1, which is in the southwest direction. Although there is an obstacle named ""obstacle_a"", it is not in the nearby, close, or very close proximity to the vehicle. Therefore, Alpha does not need to switch to the behavior of avoiding the obstacle ""obstacle_a"" at this moment.

Behavior Permutation:
No behavior permutation required.

User Query: 
Why is alpha not avoiding any obstacles and only surveying the area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective of surveying points 0, 1, 2, and 3 with a southeast heading and at a very fast speed. There are currently no obstacles present in the environment, so Alpha does not need to switch to any obstacle avoidance behaviors. It is solely focused on completing its surveying task efficiently.

Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle_c while surveying the area instead of continuing on its current path?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently surveying the area and has encountered obstacle_c in the northeast direction at a medium distance. It is important to note that obstacle_c has not been resolved yet. Alpha is following its active behavior of waypt_survey, which does not include the avoidance of obstacle_c. The decision to continue on its current path could be due to factors such as priority of the objective, limited alternative routes, or the obstacle not posing a significant threat. 

Potential Alternatives: 
1) Modify the active behavior to include avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_c in order for alpha to avoid obstacle_c while surveying the area.
2) Activate the behavior avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_c as a supplementary behavior along with waypt_survey to ensure alpha avoids obstacle_c while surveying the area.
3) If the priority of obstacle avoidance is higher, switch to the active behavior avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_c, resulting in alpha avoiding obstacle_c but ceasing the surveying of the area.

Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle C while surveying the area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective of surveying the area and is moving towards point 1 with a southwest heading and at maximum speed. It is not avoiding obstacle C because the obstacle proximity is currently 'none'. This means that obstacle C is not detected or is not in close proximity to the vehicle. Therefore, there is no need for Alpha to perform obstacle avoidance behavior.

Why is alpha not avoiding the obstacle instead of surveying the area?

Explanation 1:
Alpha is currently in the process of surveying the area and heading towards point 1 with a southwest direction at the maximum speed. Since there are no obstacles present in its path, there is no need for alpha to change its behavior and start avoiding an obstacle.

Explanation 2:
Avoiding an obstacle is a behavior specifically designed for situations where there is an obstacle present and it needs to be bypassed. In this case, there is no obstacle detected, so there is no need for alpha to activate the avoid_obstacle behavior.

Explanation 3:
Alpha might have already resolved any obstacles that were previously present and is now free to continue its surveying task without needing to avoid any obstacles.

QUERY 2:
Why is alpha not returning to its starting point instead of surveying the area?

Explanation 1:
Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective, which is to go to points 0, 1, 2, 3, and then return to the starting position. It is currently in the process of surveying the area and heading towards point 1. It will continue surveying until it reaches all the designated points before returning to the starting point.

Explanation 2:
Returning to the starting point is a behavior that is only activated when both the deploy and return flags are set to true. In this case, the return flag is set to false, indicating that alpha is not yet ready to return to the starting point and will continue surveying the area.

Explanation 3:
Alpha might need to survey the area first to gather necessary data or complete a specific task before it can safely return to the starting point. It is likely following a predetermined plan or algorithm that prioritizes surveying over returning.

QUERY 3:
Why is alpha not avoiding multiple obstacles instead of surveying the area?

Explanation 1:
Alpha is currently in the process of surveying the area and heading towards point 1, with no obstacles detected in its path. Avoiding multiple obstacles is a behavior that is only activated when there are multiple obstacles present and need to be avoided. Since there are no multiple obstacles in this scenario, there is no need for alpha to change its behavior.

Explanation 2:
Avoiding multiple obstacles can be a complex behavior that requires more resources and computing power. It is possible that alpha's current resources and capabilities are focused on efficient surveying rather than avoiding multiple obstacles.

Explanation 3:
Alpha might have already resolved any obstacles that were previously present or encountered in its path. With no multiple obstacles detected, it can continue with its surveying task without the need for additional behaviors.

Why is alpha not avoiding any obstacles while surveying the area?

Explanation 1:
Alpha is currently in the process of surveying the area and heading towards point 1. If there are no obstacles detected in its path, there is no need for alpha to activate the avoid_obstacle behavior. Avoiding obstacles while surveying may add unnecessary complexity and time to the surveying task.

Explanation 2:
Avoiding obstacles is a behavior specifically designed for situations where there is an obstacle present and it needs to be bypassed. Since there are no obstacles detected, alpha can proceed with its surveying task without the need for additional obstacle avoidance behaviors.

Explanation 3:
Alpha might have already resolved any obstacles that were previously present or encountered during its surveying task. With no obstacles detected, it can continue surveying without activating the avoid_obstacle behavior.

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently surveying the area and approaching point 2 with a southeast heading and at maximum speed. There is no obstacle present, so there is no need for the vehicle to activate the obstacle avoidance behavior. 

Potential alternative: 
Alpha could activate the avoid_obstacle behavior if there was an obstacle present in its path.

2) Why is alpha not returning to its starting point while avoiding an obstacle instead of surveying the area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently surveying the area and heading towards point 2 with a southeast heading and at maximum speed. There is no obstacle present, so the vehicle is not using the obstacle avoidance behavior. Moreover, the vehicle is not currently in the ""return"" stage, so it will not return to the starting point until it finishes its objective or receives a command from C2.

Potential alternative: 
If an obstacle is detected while surveying the area, Alpha could activate the avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a behavior to navigate around the obstacle while continuing the survey.

3) Why is alpha not moving at a slower speed instead of surveying the area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently surveying the area and approaching point 2 with a southeast heading. The vehicle is currently at maximum speed, which may be necessary to cover the survey area efficiently. Slowing down the speed might affect the surveying performance or the overall mission timeline.

Potential alternative: 
If the survey area is small or requires more attention to detail, Alpha could reduce its speed to ensure accurate data collection.

4) Why is alpha not avoiding multiple obstacles instead of surveying the area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently surveying the area and heading towards point 2 with a southeast heading at maximum speed. There is no obstacle present, so the vehicle does not activate the obstacle avoidance behavior. Moreover, the vehicle is not currently in the ""return"" stage, so it will not avoid multiple obstacles until it finishes its objective or receives a command from C2.

Potential alternative: 
If multiple obstacles are detected during the survey, Alpha could activate the avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_c behavior to navigate around them while continuing the survey.

5) Why is alpha not performing a different objective instead of surveying the area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently surveying the area and moving towards point 2 with a southeast heading at maximum speed. It is specifically assigned to survey the area, so it is not performing any other objective. The vehicle will continue to survey until it finishes its objective or receives a command from C2.

Potential alternative: 
Alpha could be assigned a different objective, such as inspecting a specific location or monitoring a different area. In that case, the active behavior would change accordingly, based on the new objective."

Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding obstacle A and obstacle E instead of just avoiding obstacle A?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently in the advanced behavior stage of its objective, moving towards point 2 with a northeast heading and at a very fast speed. The obstacle named A has been detected, and Alpha is actively avoiding it using the avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a behavior. However, there is no need for Alpha to also avoid obstacle E unless it is within the specified proximity. The decision-making logic prioritizes the avoidance of more immediate and dangerous obstacles.

- The current obstacle that alpha is facing is obstacle_a, and the vehicle is actively avoiding it. There is no mention of obstacle_c and obstacle_e in the representation, so there is no reason for alpha to avoid them.
- Obstacle_c and obstacle_e might be in different locations or not in alpha's immediate path, so alpha does not need to exhibit the behavior of avoiding them.
- Alpha might have received information that obstacle_c and obstacle_e are not threats or are already resolved, hence it is not taking any actions to avoid them.

5) Why is alpha not surveying the area and avoiding any obstacles instead of just surveying the area?
Explanations:
- Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective, which is to survey the area. The representation does not mention any obstacles other than obstacle_a, so there might not be a need for alpha to avoid any other obstacles.
- Alpha might have received information that obstacle_a is the only obstacle that requires avoidance, and the surveying behavior does not need to be modified.
- The objective of surveying the area might not require alpha to avoid any obstacles, as it is focused on collecting data rather than obstacle avoidance.

Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle_b instead of obstacle_a while surveying the area?

Explanation 1:
Alpha is currently avoiding obstacle A because it has been detected as the nearest obstacle with a close proximity. The decision to avoid obstacle A instead of obstacle B is based on the location and distance of the obstacles in relation to the vehicle's current position and surveying path.

Explanation 2:
Obstacle A might pose a higher risk or a more immediate threat compared to obstacle B. The decision to prioritize obstacle A over obstacle B could be based on factors such as obstacle size, speed, or its potential to cause damage or hinder the vehicle's motion.

Explanation 3:
The order in which the obstacles are detected and prioritized for avoidance might be determined by their position in the surveying route. In this case, obstacle A is encountered before obstacle B, leading to the decision to avoid obstacle A first.

User Query 2:
Why is alpha not returning to its starting point while avoiding an obstacle?

Explanation 1:
Alpha is currently surveying the area and actively avoiding an obstacle. The decision to continue surveying instead of returning to the starting point is based on the priority of completing the survey task and maximizing the amount of data gathered before resolving the obstacle issue.

Explanation 2:
Returning to the starting point while avoiding an obstacle might not be the most efficient or timely decision. It could involve deviating from the designated survey route and interrupting the data collection process, which could lead to incomplete or inaccurate results.

Explanation 3:
Alpha might be programmed to prioritize obstacle resolution over returning to the starting point due to safety considerations. By resolving the obstacle and ensuring a clear surveying path, the vehicle can minimize the risk of encountering additional obstacles during the return journey.

User Query 3:
Why is alpha not avoiding both obstacle_c and obstacle_e instead of just obstacle_c while surveying the area?

Explanation 1:
Alpha might be designed to prioritize and avoid the nearest obstacle first, which in this case is obstacle C. By resolving obstacle C first, the vehicle can ensure its immediate safety before addressing the potential threat posed by obstacle E.

Explanation 2:
The decision to avoid only obstacle C might be based on its proximity to the vehicle's current position. If obstacle C is considered the more immediate danger, the vehicle would prioritize avoiding it first and then proceed to address obstacle E.

Explanation 3:
The behavior of avoiding both obstacle C and obstacle E simultaneously might not be supported or programmed into the vehicle's decision-making logic. This could be due to limitations in sensor capabilities, maneuverability, or computational resources required for navigating multiple obstacles simultaneously.

Alpha is currently surveying the area while avoiding obstacle A, which is located in the northeast direction and is very close to the vehicle. This behavior is chosen based on the assumption that obstacle A poses a higher risk or is more critical to avoid compared to obstacle B. The decision-making logic prioritizes avoiding obstacles based on their proximity and potential danger.

User Query: 
Why is alpha not idle instead of surveying an area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently deployed and has an objective to go to multiple points and return to the starting position. Therefore, staying idle is not considered an active behavior for the vehicle in this scenario. The decision-making logic ensures that the vehicle is always engaged in a behavior that aligns with its assigned objective. Additionally, being idle may be inefficient and not in line with the overall mission or operational requirements.

User Query: 
Why is alpha not returning to its starting point instead of surveying an area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective, which involves reaching multiple points and returning to the starting position. Surveying the area is an essential part of achieving this objective. By surveying the area, the vehicle can gather data or perform tasks that contribute to the mission requirements or operational goals. Returning to the starting point without completing the survey would result in incomplete data or a lack of fulfillment of the mission objectives.

Why is alpha not avoiding any obstacle while surveying the area?

Explanation: 
Based on the current representation, there is no obstacle present or detected in the vehicle's proximity. Therefore, there is no need for the vehicle to engage in the behavior of avoiding obstacles while surveying the area. The decision-making logic ensures that the vehicle only engages in obstacle avoidance behaviors when there is an actual obstacle present, and its proximity and criticality meet the defined conditions.

Why is alpha not avoiding the obstacle and returning to its starting point instead of surveying the area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently deployed and its objective is to move towards point 3 while also avoiding obstacle A. The proximity of obstacle A is very close, indicating a high risk of collision. To ensure safety, Alpha is actively engaged in surveying the area while avoiding the obstacle. The decision to survey rather than return is based on prioritizing the completion of the objective while taking necessary precautions for obstacle avoidance.

Alternative Behavior 1: 
Active Behavior: waypt_return
Explanation: 
Instead of surveying the area while avoiding the obstacle, Alpha could switch to the Waypt_return behavior. This behavior would prioritize returning to the starting point over surveying or obstacle avoidance. However, this alternative behavior would result in not completing the objective of reaching point 3.

Alternative Behavior 2: 
Active Behavior: waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_b
Explanation: 
Another possible alternative behavior for Alpha could be to engage in surveying the area while avoiding obstacle B. This behavior would involve adjusting the trajectory and heading to avoid obstacle B while continuing towards point 3. However, this alternative behavior may not be feasible if obstacle B is not present or if obstacle A poses a higher risk.

Alternative Behavior 3: 
Active Behavior: waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_c,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e
Explanation: 
Alpha could also perform a more comprehensive obstacle avoidance strategy by actively avoiding obstacles C and E in addition to obstacle A. This behavior would allow Alpha to safely navigate the area while still progressing towards point 3. However, this behavior would require additional computational resources and may not be necessary if obstacles C and E do not pose a significant threat.

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently in the completed phase of its objective, which means it has finished its surveying task and is returning to its starting point. There is no obstacle present that needs to be avoided, so there is no need for alpha to exhibit the avoid_obstacle behavior. Being idle is the appropriate behavior in this situation.

2) Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding obstacle C instead of returning to its starting point?

Explanation: 
Alpha has completed its objective and is currently returning to its starting point. It has encountered obstacle C, but it is already in the process of returning, so the priority shifts from surveying to avoiding obstacles. Returning to the starting point while avoiding obstacle C is the appropriate behavior for alpha in this scenario.

3) Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding obstacle B and obstacle E instead of returning to its starting point?

Explanation: 
Alpha has completed its objective and is currently returning to its starting point. It has encountered obstacles B and E, but it is already in the process of returning, so the priority shifts from surveying to avoiding obstacles. Returning to the starting point while avoiding obstacle B and obstacle E is the appropriate behavior for alpha in this scenario.

Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding obstacle_a instead of being idle?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently in an idle state because its deploy and return values are both false. As a result, it is not actively engaged in any behavior. This can be due to several reasons: there may be no need to survey the area at the moment, there may be no obstacles present, or there may be other more important tasks to prioritize.

Explanation:

Alpha is currently in the process of returning to its starting point as instructed by its objective. Since the obstacle_a is nearby and has not been resolved yet, it is necessary for the vehicle to prioritize avoiding the obstacle while returning. Therefore, it is not currently surveying the area. 

Alternatives:
- Alpha could survey the area while avoiding obstacle_a, if the objective allows for it, and then continue returning to its starting point.
- Alpha could prioritize resolving obstacle_a before returning to its starting point, ensuring that the obstacle is removed or it can navigate around it safely before continuing with the objective.
- Alpha could temporarily pause its return to the starting point and survey the area around obstacle_a before resuming its return.

2) Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding obstacle obstacle_b instead of returning to its starting point?

Explanation:

Alpha is currently in the process of returning to its starting point as instructed by its objective. Although obstacle_b is present, it is not in proximity to the vehicle, so there is no immediate need to avoid it. Therefore, the vehicle is not surveying the area while avoiding obstacle_b at the moment.

Alternatives:
- Alpha could still survey the area while avoiding obstacle_b as a precautionary measure, even though it is not nearby. This would provide more comprehensive data about the surrounding environment.
- Alpha could switch to surveying the area while avoiding obstacle_b if there is a change in the proximity of the obstacle or if it becomes necessary to gather more information about obstacle_b.
- Alpha could prioritize resolving obstacle_b before returning to its starting point if the obstacle becomes a higher priority or poses a potential threat.

3) Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding obstacle obstacle_c instead of returning to its starting point?

Explanation:

Alpha is currently in the process of returning to its starting point as instructed by its objective. Although obstacle_c is present, it is not in proximity to the vehicle, so there is no immediate need to avoid it. Therefore, the vehicle is not surveying the area while avoiding obstacle_c at the moment.

Alternatives:
- Alpha could still survey the area while avoiding obstacle_c as a precautionary measure, even though it is not nearby. This would provide more comprehensive data about the surrounding environment.
- Alpha could switch to surveying the area while avoiding obstacle_c if there is a change in the proximity of the obstacle or if it becomes necessary to gather more information about obstacle_c.

Why is alpha not avoiding the obstacle and returning to its starting point instead of surveying an area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently in the behavior of returning to its starting point. Since there is an obstacle present (obstacle_a) in the southeast direction, Alpha should ideally avoid the obstacle while returning. However, the obstacle is not yet resolved, which means that it is not safe for Alpha to navigate around the obstacle.

Why is alpha not avoiding the obstacle while returning to its starting point?

Explanation: 
Alpha is returning to its starting point because its objective is to complete the assigned waypoints and then return. However, it is not avoiding the obstacle because the obstacle proximity is categorized as ""far,"" indicating that it is not immediately in the vehicle's path. Therefore, there is no need for the vehicle to change its behavior and avoid the obstacle.

Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding an obstacle instead of returning to its starting point?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently in the return stage and its objective is to return to its starting point. Since there is an obstacle present (obstacle_a) and it is not resolved yet, it is prioritizing obstacle avoidance over surveying the area. The obstacle is located in the southeast direction, so returning to the starting point is a safer option.

Potential Alternatives:
1) Surveying the area while avoiding the obstacle: Alpha can change its behavior to ""Waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a"" to survey the area while actively avoiding the obstacle.
2) Continuing the return to starting point without avoiding the obstacle: If the obstacle is not a safety concern or if resolving the obstacle is not a priority at the moment, Alpha can continue its return to the starting point without actively avoiding the obstacle.
3) Modifying the obstacle resolution priority: If Alpha needs to prioritize surveying the area over obstacle avoidance, the obstacle resolution priority can be modified in the decision-making logic.

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently in the process of returning to its starting point as per its objective. It is traveling at maximum speed with a northwest heading. The obstacle, obstacle_a, is currently very far from the vehicle, and therefore the vehicle does not need to prioritize avoiding it at the moment.

Explanations:
- Alpha is currently in the return stage of its objective, which means its primary task is to return to its starting point. The vehicle is not actively surveying the area or encountering any obstacles at the moment.
- If there is a need for alpha to survey the area while avoiding an obstacle, it would require an obstacle to be present and unresolved. Since the obstacle name is 'none' and the obstacle resolved is 'True', there is no need for alpha to perform the avoid_obstacle behavior.
- In this case, the objective of returning to the starting point takes precedence over surveying the area and avoiding obstacles.

2) Why is alpha not idle with no activated behavior instead of returning to its starting point?

Explanations:
- The vehicle state representation indicates that alpha is currently in the return stage of its objective, which means it needs to return to its starting point. If alpha becomes idle without any activated behavior, it would deviate from its objective.
- The decision to return to the starting point is likely based on an external command or completion of the surveying task. The vehicle is programmed to follow its objective rather than staying idle.
- In the absence of any external command or completion of the task, alpha would continue executing its objective until instructed otherwise.

3) Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding obstacles A and B instead of returning to its starting point?

Explanations:
- The vehicle state representation shows that alpha is currently in the return stage of its objective, prioritizing returning to the starting point over surveying the area and avoiding obstacles.
- To perform the behavior permutation of surveying the area while avoiding obstacles A and B, there should be unresolved obstacles with names A and B. Since the obstacle name is 'none' and the obstacle resolved is 'True', there are no obstacles present that need to be avoided.
- The current behavior of returning to the starting point is based on the vehicle's objective and the absence of any obstacles to be avoided.

Explanation:
Alpha is currently surveying the area without considering any obstacles. This behavior might be chosen because there are no obstacles present in the environment, or the vehicle's obstacle detection system is not fully functional. Another potential reason could be that the vehicle's priority is to complete the surveying task efficiently, so it ignores the obstacles for the time being.

2) Why is alpha not returning to its starting point while avoiding obstacles instead of just surveying the area?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently surveying the area without considering any obstacles but will return to its starting point once it completes the survey. This behavior might be chosen because the surveying task is the priority at the moment, and the vehicle is confident that it can avoid any obstacles it encounters on the return path. Alternatively, it could be due to the absence of obstacles in the path or the lack of obstacle detection capability.

3) Why is alpha not completing the survey objective and returning to the starting point instead of just surveying the area?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently surveying the area and has not completed its objective. This behavior might be chosen because there are more points to survey, or the vehicle has received a new instruction to survey additional points before returning to the starting point. Alternatively, it could be due to an error in the vehicle's navigation system, preventing it from reaching the next point or identifying the starting point accurately.

Explanation:
Alpha is currently surveying the area with the objective of going to points 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 before returning to its starting position. At this moment, there are no obstacles present (obstacle_name = 'none') and no proximity to any obstacles (obstacle_proximity = 'none'). Therefore, there is no need for alpha to activate the behavior of avoiding obstacles.

2) Why is alpha not surveying the area and avoiding obstacles of type ""avoid_obstacle_d""?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently surveying the area and its active behavior, 'waypt_survey', does not include avoiding obstacles of type ""avoid_obstacle_d"". The decision-making rules suggest that if there is a need to avoid an obstacle, the obstacle name should not be 'none' and the obstacle resolved should be false. Since there are no obstacles present (obstacle_name = 'none') and no need to avoid any obstacles (obstacle_resolved = false), alpha does not need to activate the behavior of avoiding obstacles of type ""avoid_obstacle_d"".

3) Why is alpha not avoiding obstacles of type ""avoid_obstacle_b"" while surveying the area?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently surveying the area and its active behavior, 'waypt_survey', does not include avoiding obstacles of type ""avoid_obstacle_b"". The decision-making rules require that if there is a need to avoid an obstacle, the obstacle name should not be 'none' and the obstacle resolved should be false. Since there are no obstacles present (obstacle_name = 'none') and no need to avoid any obstacles (obstacle_resolved = false), alpha does not need to activate the behavior of avoiding obstacles of type ""avoid_obstacle_b"".

4) Why is alpha not returning to its starting point while avoiding obstacles of type ""avoid_obstacle_d""?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective of going to points 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 before returning to its starting position. Since the obstacle name is 'none' and the obstacle resolved is false, there is no need for alpha to activate the behavior of avoiding obstacles. Therefore, there is no reason for alpha to return to its starting point while avoiding obstacles of type ""avoid_obstacle_d"".

5) Why is alpha not surveying the area and avoiding multiple obstacles simultaneously?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently surveying the area, but its active behavior, 'waypt_survey', does not include avoiding multiple obstacles simultaneously. The decision-making rules suggest that if there is a need to avoid an obstacle, the obstacle name should not be 'none', the obstacle resolved should be false, and the obstacle proximity should have a value nearby, close, or very close. Since there are no obstacles present (obstacle_name = 'none') and no need to avoid any obstacles (obstacle_resolved = false), alpha does not need to activate the behavior of avoiding multiple obstacles simultaneously.

2) Why is alpha not avoiding obstacles while surveying the area?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently surveying the area without considering any obstacles. This behavior may be suitable if there are no known obstacles in the area, or if the vehicle has separate obstacle avoidance capabilities. To avoid obstacles while surveying, Alpha could be equipped with obstacle detection and avoidance systems, allowing it to navigate around obstacles and continue its surveying mission.

3) Why is alpha avoiding obstacle A instead of obstacle B while surveying the area?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently configured to avoid obstacle A while surveying the area. This behavior may be based on the priority or severity of obstacle A, or the specific mission objectives. To avoid obstacle B instead, Alpha could be reprogrammed or reconfigured to prioritize obstacle B over obstacle A, considering factors such as proximity, size, or potential impact on the mission.

4) Why is alpha not returning to its starting point while avoiding an obstacle?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently surveying the area while avoiding an obstacle. Returning to the starting point may not be the highest priority, as the avoidance of the obstacle takes precedence. The vehicle's decision-making logic considers the obstacle proximity and its impact on the mission before deciding on the behavior. To prioritize returning to the starting point while avoiding the obstacle, the logic could be modified to assign a higher weight to returning.

2) Why is alpha not surveying the area and avoiding obstacles at the same time?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently focusing on the objective of surveying the area and is not specifically programmed to avoid obstacles while doing so. This behavior may be chosen if the emphasis is on completing the survey in a timely manner without worrying about obstacles.

Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle_c while surveying the area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently surveying the area and has encountered obstacle_c. However, it is not avoiding the obstacle because the obstacle proximity is reported as ""none"". It is likely that the sensor responsible for detecting obstacles is not functioning properly or there is a communication issue between the sensor and the decision-making logic.

Potential Alternatives: 
1) Modify the obstacle detection algorithm to ensure that obstacle_c is properly detected and its proximity is accurately reported.
2) Implement a fail-safe mechanism that activates the avoidance behavior regardless of the reported obstacle proximity, as long as an obstacle is detected.
3) Update the behavior logic to prioritize obstacle avoidance over surveying, so that the vehicle automatically switches to an avoidance behavior when an obstacle is detected.

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently surveying the area while heading towards point 1 with a southwest direction and at a very fast speed. The obstacle in its path is obstacle_c, which is located in the southeast direction. Since the obstacle_c is not obstacle_b, there is no need for alpha to avoid obstacle_b.

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective of moving towards point 1 with a southwest direction and at a very fast speed. It is also avoiding the obstacle_c located in the southeast direction. To return to its starting point, alpha must first complete its objective or receive a command from C2.

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently surveying the area towards point 1 with a southwest direction and at a very fast speed. It is also avoiding the obstacle_c and obstacle_e located in its path. Given the current objective and the presence of obstacle_c and obstacle_e, there is no need for alpha to specifically avoid obstacle_a. However, if the obstacle_c and obstacle_e are resolved, alpha can consider avoiding obstacle_a if it becomes a priority.

4) Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding obstacle_c and obstacle_b instead of just surveying the area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently surveying the area towards point 1 with a southwest direction and at a very fast speed. The current objective and the absence of other obstacles except obstacle_c do not necessitate alpha to avoid obstacle_c and obstacle_b. However, if obstacle_b becomes a potential obstruction in alpha's path or is added to the list of obstacles to be avoided, alpha can adopt the behavior of avoiding obstacle_c and obstacle_b while surveying the area.

Explanation: Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective, which includes avoiding obstacle_c. The presence of obstacle_c is considered more critical or urgent compared to obstacle_e. Therefore, the active behavior prioritizes avoiding obstacle_c over avoiding obstacle_e.

2) Why is alpha not surveying the area without avoiding any obstacles instead of surveying while avoiding obstacle_c and obstacle_e?
Explanation: Alpha is currently deployed to survey the area while avoiding obstacle_c and obstacle_e. This behavior is chosen because there are potential obstacles present that should be avoided to ensure the safety of the vehicle. If the vehicle surveyed the area without avoiding any obstacles, it could potentially collide with or be obstructed by them.

3) Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding obstacle_a instead of avoiding obstacle_c and obstacle_e?
Explanation: Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective and avoid obstacles_c and e. These specific obstacles may pose a greater risk or have higher priority compared to obstacle_a. The decision to avoid obstacle_c and obstacle_e instead of obstacle_a is based on prioritizing the immediate safety concerns.

Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle C while surveying the area instead of continuing its survey?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently surveying the area and has encountered obstacle C, which is in close proximity. The vehicle is programmed to avoid obstacles, but it may have determined that it can safely bypass obstacle C without deviating from its intended survey path. The decision to continue the survey instead of avoiding obstacle C could be based on factors such as the size and nature of the obstacle, the available space to maneuver, and the importance of completing the survey without unnecessary interruptions.

Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective, which includes surveying points 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. It is currently encountering obstacle_c, which is very close to its current position. Alpha should be avoiding the obstacle while surveying the area to ensure its safety and prevent any potential collisions. However, it is not avoiding the obstacle as it should be.

Potential Alternatives:

Explanation: Alpha is currently surveying the area and avoiding obstacle_c based on the decision-making rules. The active behavior ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_c"" indicates that the vehicle is programmed to avoid obstacle_c specifically. To switch to avoiding obstacle_e, the vehicle's behavior would need to be modified to ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e"".

2) Why is alpha not idle instead of surveying the area?

Explanation: Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective, which is to go to points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and then return to the starting position. Since the objective is active and the vehicle is in-transit towards the next point, it is not idle. To make alpha idle, the behavior would need to be changed to ""none"".

3) Why is alpha not returning to its starting point instead of surveying the area when obstacle_c is resolved?

Explanation: Alpha is currently surveying the area and avoiding obstacle_c. The decision-making rule for returning to the starting point only applies when the vehicle is not avoiding any obstacles. Thus, even if obstacle_c is resolved, alpha will continue surveying the area until its objective is completed or modified.

Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle a instead of surveying the area?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective, which includes surveying the area and avoiding any obstacles that may be present. The obstacle in this case is obstacle c, located in the northeast direction and very close to the vehicle. The active behavior of ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_c"" ensures that the vehicle continues to survey the area while also avoiding obstacle c. This behavior is chosen to complete the objective while maintaining safety.

Potential Alternatives:
1) None: The vehicle could stop all behaviors and remain idle. However, this would prevent the vehicle from completing its objective of surveying the area and hinder its mission.
2) Waypt_survey: The vehicle could continue surveying the area without actively avoiding obstacle c. However, this would pose a safety risk as the obstacle is in close proximity and could potentially cause a collision.
3) Waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a: The vehicle could modify its behavior to avoid obstacle a instead of obstacle c. However, this would not be the optimal choice as obstacle c is the obstacle that is currently very close to the vehicle and poses a more immediate risk.

Why is alpha not avoiding the obstacle when surveying the area?

Explanation 1:
Alpha is currently surveying the area and is aware of the presence of obstacle E, which is located nearby in the southwest direction. However, it seems that the obstacle has not been resolved yet. The current behavior is to continue surveying the area while avoiding the obstacle, but it seems that alpha has not yet initiated the avoidance maneuver. This could be due to various reasons, such as: 
1) The obstacle is not deemed as an immediate threat and the vehicle has determined that it can continue surveying without altering its course. 
2) The vehicle's avoidance algorithm is prioritizing the completion of the survey objective over avoiding the obstacle at the moment. 
3) There might be other constraints or considerations in place that prevent alpha from immediately avoiding the obstacle, such as limited maneuverability or safety margins.

User Query 2:
Why is alpha not returning to its starting position when obstacle E is nearby?

Explanation 2:
Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective of going to points 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. While enroute to point 1, it has encountered obstacle E, located nearby in the southwest direction. Although the vehicle is aware of the obstacle and it is not yet resolved, alpha is not immediately returning to its starting position. The reasons for this could include:
1) The vehicle's priority is to complete the survey objective before returning to the starting position, and it considers obstacle E to be manageable or non-urgent for the time being.
2) Alpha might have a predefined plan to survey the area in a specific sequence and it is programmed to prioritize waypoint surveying over returning to the starting point when an obstacle is encountered.
3) The vehicle might have received a command or instruction from the central command (C2) to continue the survey despite the presence of the obstacle, indicating that temporarily avoiding the obstacle and continuing the surveying task is preferable.

User Query 3:
Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle C when it is present during the survey?

Explanation 3:
Alpha is currently engaged in waypoint surveying and is aware of the presence of obstacle C. However, alpha's behavior does not involve explicit avoidance of obstacle C during the survey. The potential reasons for this include:
1) Obstacle C might not pose a significant threat to the vehicle or its surveying objective. It could be determined that the vehicle can safely navigate around or past obstacle C without any dedicated avoidance maneuvers.
2) The avoidance algorithm might have prioritized obstacle E over obstacle C, as obstacle E might be considered more critical or preferable to avoid.
3) There might be constraints or limitations in place that prevent alpha from avoiding both obstacle C and obstacle E simultaneously, and the current behavior configuration chooses to prioritize obstacle E avoidance over obstacle C avoidance.

Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle_a instead of surveying the area while avoiding obstacle_c and obstacle_e?

Explanation 1:
Alpha is currently prioritizing the avoidance of obstacle_c and obstacle_e over obstacle_a. This could be due to the relative proximity of the obstacles and their potential risk levels. The decision-making logic of the agent may have determined that avoiding obstacle_c and obstacle_e is more critical than avoiding obstacle_a. It could also be that obstacle_a is further away or poses a lower risk to the vehicle compared to obstacle_c and obstacle_e.

Explanation 2:
The active behavior of surveying the area while avoiding obstacle_c and obstacle_e may have been specifically designed to handle situations where multiple obstacles are present. This behavior allows the vehicle to efficiently navigate around obstacles while continuing to perform its objective of surveying the area. By prioritizing the avoidance of obstacle_c and obstacle_e, the agent ensures that the vehicle can safely continue its mission without being deterred by these obstacles.

Explanation 3:
Another reason for not avoiding obstacle_a could be related to the overall mission objectives and priorities. The agent may consider obstacle_a as a lower priority obstacle that can be dealt with later or resolved in a different way. It is possible that avoiding obstacle_a would significantly deviate the vehicle from its intended path or cause delays in completing the mission. Therefore, the agent may have decided to focus on avoiding obstacle_c and obstacle_e first, while potentially addressing obstacle_a at a later stage.

User Query 2:
Why is alpha not returning to its starting point while avoiding obstacle_e instead of surveying the area while avoiding obstacle_c and obstacle_e?

Explanation 1:
Alpha is currently in the process of surveying the area and avoiding obstacle_c and obstacle_e. Returning to its starting point while avoiding obstacle_e may not be the optimal behavior in the current situation. The decision-making logic of the agent may prioritize the completion of the surveying objective over returning to the starting point. The agent might consider completing the survey as a higher priority and then dealing with obstacle_e during the return phase.

Explanation 2:
The active behavior of surveying the area while avoiding obstacle_c and obstacle_e may be considered a necessary step before returning to the starting point. The agent may have determined that gathering data or information from the area is crucial for the overall mission objectives. By prioritizing the surveying behavior, the agent ensures that the vehicle collects all required data before repositioning to the starting point.

Explanation 3:
Returning to the starting point while avoiding obstacle_e may not be feasible or efficient based on the vehicle's current position and the obstacle's proximity. It is possible that obstacle_e is located in a way that forces the vehicle to take a significantly longer or riskier route to the starting point. By continuing to survey the area, the agent can wait for a more opportune moment or a better path to navigate around obstacle_e during the return phase.

User Query 3:
Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle_a and obstacle_b instead of surveying the area while avoiding obstacle_c and obstacle_e?

Explanation 1:
The decision-making logic of the agent may have determined that obstacle_c and obstacle_e pose a higher risk or have a more immediate impact on the vehicle's ability to perform its objective compared to obstacle_a and obstacle_b. Thus, the agent prioritizes avoiding obstacle_c and obstacle_e over the other two obstacles.

Explanation 2:
The active behavior of surveying the area while avoiding obstacle_c and obstacle_e could be specifically designed to handle situations where these obstacles are considered more critical or challenging to navigate around. The behavior may incorporate specific avoidance strategies or utilize the vehicle's capabilities in a more efficient manner when dealing with these specific obstacles. It is possible that obstacle_a and obstacle_b are considered less significant and can be resolved or avoided with less complex behaviors.

Explanation 3:
Avoiding obstacle_a and obstacle_b may not be required or necessary for the completion of the mission objectives. The agent may have incorporated a risk assessment and determined that the impact or risk level associated with obstacle_a and obstacle_b is within acceptable limits. Therefore, the agent focuses on avoiding obstacle_c and obstacle_e, which are considered higher priority obstacles that could significantly hinder the vehicle's progress or safety.

Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle obstacle_c instead of surveying the area while avoiding obstacles?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective of moving towards point 1 with a southeast heading and at a very fast speed. However, there is an obstacle named obstacle_c in close proximity to the vehicle. Therefore, to ensure the vehicle's safety, it is actively avoiding this obstacle. The active behavior of surveying the area while avoiding obstacles allows the vehicle to continue its objective while maintaining a safe distance from the obstacle. If the vehicle were to solely focus on avoiding the obstacle and not continue its objective, it may not be able to complete its mission.

This would allow the vehicle to focus solely on its objective of moving towards point 1 and gather the required data without diverting its attention to obstacle avoidance.

Alternative 3: 
Original: waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_c,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e
Modified: waypt_return

Explanation: 
Instead of continuing to survey the area and avoid obstacles, the vehicle could change its behavior to waypt_return. This would immediately initiate the return to the starting point, disregarding the surveying objective and any obstacles in the vicinity. This alternative behavior may be chosen if the time constraints for completing the survey are not critical or if returning to the starting point becomes the priority."

Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle_c instead of obstacle_e while surveying the area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently deployed to survey the area and avoid obstacle_e, which is located in the southwest direction. The decision to avoid obstacle_e was based on its proximity to the vehicle, which is defined as ""nearby"". Obstacle_c, on the other hand, may not be a threat to the vehicle or it may not be in the vehicle's path. Therefore, Alpha does not need to avoid obstacle_c at the moment.

Why is alpha surveying an area and not avoiding obstacle_e?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective, which is to move towards point 1 with a southeast heading and at a very fast speed. However, it has encountered obstacle_e in the southwest direction and is in the nearby proximity of the obstacle. The active behavior includes the avoidance of obstacles, but it seems that the logic to avoid obstacle_e is not being triggered. There could be several reasons for this, such as the obstacle resolution mechanism not being activated or the obstacle proximity not being properly detected.

Potential Alternatives:
1) Alpha could continue to survey the area while avoiding obstacle_e by modifying the behavior to include the necessary obstacle avoidance actions.
2) Alpha could change its behavior to prioritize avoiding obstacle_e over surveying the area, ensuring that it promptly maneuvers around the obstacle.
3) Alpha could choose to abort the surveying behavior altogether and focus solely on avoiding obstacle_e until it is resolved or a command is received from C2.

Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle_b instead of obstacle_e?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently surveying the area and is encountering obstacle E, which is in the southwest direction. The active behavior of avoiding obstacle E is chosen because it is the closest obstacle and the vehicle is programmed to prioritize avoiding obstacles that are closer. Obstacle B may not be considered as the active behavior because it is not in proximity to the vehicle.

User Query:
Why is alpha not deploying and surveying an area without avoiding any obstacles?

Explanation: 
Currently, alpha is deployed but the surveying behavior is combined with obstacle avoidance. This is because there is an obstacle present (obstacle E) and the vehicle is programmed to prioritize obstacle avoidance while surveying. If there are no obstacles present, alpha can deploy and perform the surveying behavior without the need for obstacle avoidance.

Why is alpha not idling instead of surveying an area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective of surveying the area and moving towards the next point, which is point 1 in the southeast direction at a very fast speed. If alpha were to idle instead of surveying, it would not be fulfilling its objective and would just remain inactive. Idling is only activated when both the deploy and return flags are set to false, indicating that the vehicle is not assigned any task and is waiting for further instructions.

Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle B instead of continuing with the survey?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently surveying the area and has encountered obstacle E, which is very close in the southwest direction.

User Query: 
Why is alpha not returning to its starting point while avoiding an obstacle?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently surveying the area and has encountered obstacle E, which is very close in the southwest direction. Since the return parameter is set to false, alpha will not prioritize returning to its starting point unless an obstacle is in proximity. In this scenario, the decision-making logic allows alpha to continue with the survey while avoiding obstacle E. Returning to the starting point is a secondary objective that alpha will only consider if obstacle E is resolved or the agent receives a specific command.

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently surveying the area and has encountered obstacle E, which is very close in the southwest direction. The decision-making logic evaluates the proximity and type of obstacles and chooses the behavior permutation that is most appropriate for the current situation. In this case, obstacle E is given higher priority than obstacle A due to its proximity. The current behavior permutation already includes the avoidance of obstacle E, so there is no need for alpha to switch to avoiding obstacle A.

1) Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle obstacle_a instead of surveying the area with obstacle_e?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently surveying the area to complete its objective of visiting multiple points. Since obstacle_e is in its path, it is actively avoiding it by incorporating the ""avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e"" behavior. If obstacle_a was present instead of obstacle_e, the vehicle would need to incorporate the ""avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a"" behavior to avoid it.

2) Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding both obstacle_a and obstacle_b instead of only avoiding obstacle_e?

Explanation: 
Alpha encountered obstacle_e while surveying the area and is actively avoiding it by incorporating the ""avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e"" behavior. However, if both obstacle_a and obstacle_b were present, alpha should exhibit the ""avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a"" and ""avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_b"" behaviors to avoid both obstacles simultaneously while surveying the area.

3) Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding all available obstacles instead of only avoiding obstacle_e?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently surveying the area and avoiding obstacle_e by incorporating the ""avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e"" behavior.

Explanation:
Alpha is currently deployed with the objective of moving towards point 1 with a southwest heading and at a very fast speed. The vehicle is also avoiding obstacle E, which is in the northwest direction and at a close proximity. To return to its starting point, it should either finish its objective of reaching point 1 or receive a command from C2.

Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle E while surveying the area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently in the process of surveying an area and is approaching point 1 with a southwest heading and at a very fast speed. The obstacle proximity to obstacle E is currently far away, so there is no immediate need for alpha to avoid it. Alpha will only start avoiding obstacle E if it gets closer and the obstacle proximity changes.

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently surveying the area while approaching point 1 with a southeast heading and at a very fast speed. The obstacle_e is nearby and has not been resolved yet. Although avoiding the obstacle would be a safer option, the current behavior of surveying the area while approaching the point is prioritized. This behavior allows the vehicle to fulfill its objective while collecting data and can potentially avoid the obstacle on its way back.

2) Why is alpha not returning to its starting point while avoiding obstacle_e instead of surveying the area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently surveying the area while approaching point 1 with a southeast heading and at a very fast speed. The obstacle_e is nearby and has not been resolved yet. However, the current behavior of surveying the area is considered more important than returning to the starting point and avoiding the obstacle. The objective is to collect data from each point, and returning to the starting point can be postponed until all points have been surveyed.

3) Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle_e and obstacle_c instead of surveying the area while approaching point 1?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently surveying the area while approaching point 1 with a southeast heading and at a very fast speed. Both obstacle_e and obstacle_c are nearby and have not been resolved yet. However, the current behavior of surveying the area is chosen instead of avoiding the obstacles. This decision is based on the priority to fulfill the objective of collecting data from each point, and avoiding obstacles can be done on the way back to the starting point.

Why is alpha not avoiding the obstacle_e and surveying the area instead?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective, which is to move towards point 1 with a southeast heading and at a very fast speed. The obstacle_e is currently at a medium distance from the vehicle. However, the obstacle has not been resolved yet, and therefore, alpha is unable to avoid it. As a result, alpha continues to survey the area instead of avoiding the obstacle.

Potential alternatives:
1) Alpha could switch to the behavior ""Waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e"" which includes the avoidance behavior for obstacle_e.
2) Alpha could stop surveying the area temporarily and focus on resolving the obstacle before continuing the survey.
3) Alpha could slow down its speed while surveying the area, allowing it to better handle the obstacle and avoid collisions.

The decision to not avoid these obstacles during the survey phase is based on the assumption that they do not pose an immediate risk or hinder the completion of the survey. This behavior is chosen to optimize the surveying process and avoid unnecessary obstacle avoidance actions.

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently on its way to point 2 with a southeast direction and at a very fast speed. The current behavior is to move towards the next point in the specified direction. If the behavior is modified to move towards the next point in a northeast direction, it would deviate from its planned route and potentially not reach the designated points. The current behavior ensures that the vehicle follows the planned path and reaches the points in the specified order.

User Query: Why is alpha not avoiding the obstacle ""Obstacle A"" instead of continuing to move towards its next point without resolving the obstacle?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently in transit towards its next point and has encountered an obstacle named ""Obstacle A"". The current behavior is to continue moving towards the next point without resolving the obstacle. This behavior assumes that the obstacle does not pose a significant threat or obstruction to the vehicle's path. Avoiding the obstacle may result in unnecessary deviation from the planned route and could potentially cause delays in reaching the intended points. The priority is given to reaching the designated points rather than avoiding minor obstacles.

User Query: Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding obstacle B instead of surveying the area without resolving any obstacles?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently surveying the area as its active behavior, which aims to gather information about the environment. The decision-making logic does not prioritize obstacle avoidance during the surveying activity unless an obstacle poses an immediate threat to the vehicle's safety. As obstacle B does not meet the criteria for immediate threat, the current behavior is to continue surveying without resolving the obstacle. This allows the vehicle to fulfill its primary objective of gathering information efficiently.

User Query: Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding obstacles C and E instead of surveying the area and only avoiding obstacle C?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently surveying the area and avoiding obstacle C based on the active behavior. The decision-making logic does not extend the avoidance behavior to obstacle E as it might not present an immediate threat to the vehicle's safety during the surveying activity. The current behavior enables the vehicle to focus on its primary objective of surveying while efficiently avoiding obstacle C. The inclusion of obstacle E in the avoidance behavior would introduce unnecessary deviations and potentially hinder the surveying process.

4) Why doesn't alpha avoid the obstacle while returning to its starting point?

Explanation: 
The vehicle is currently not facing any obstacles while returning to its starting point, so there is no need to activate the obstacle avoidance behavior. The vehicle will only activate the avoid_obstacle behavior if it detects an obstacle nearby, close, or very close to its path.

5) Can alpha avoid obstacle_e instead of obstacle_a and obstacle_c while surveying the area?

Explanation: 
Currently, there is no obstacle present in the vehicle's path while it is surveying the area. Hence, there is no need for the vehicle to activate the obstacle avoidance behavior. However, if an obstacle is detected and it happens to be obstacle_e, then the vehicle can activate the avoid_obstacle_e behavior to avoid it.

Why is alpha not avoiding obstacles while surveying the area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective of surveying the area and is in an advanced behavior stage. At this stage, there are no obstacles present, so there is no need for alpha to avoid any obstacles. If an obstacle were to be detected, alpha would switch to a behavior that includes obstacle avoidance.

Why is alpha not returning to its starting point while avoiding obstacles?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective of returning to its starting point. At the same time, it is also avoiding any obstacles in its path. The presence of obstacles does not change alpha's objective, so it continues to prioritize returning to the starting point. If the obstacles become too close, alpha may switch to a behavior that prioritizes obstacle avoidance.

Explanations:
- Alpha is currently surveying the area while heading towards point 4 and with a northwest heading at a very fast speed. Since the obstacle proximity is ""none"" and the obstacle is not resolved, there is no need for alpha to avoid the obstacle at this moment.
- Avoiding the obstacle may not be necessary because the obstacle name is not specified, indicating that it may not be a significant obstacle that requires the vehicle to change its behavior.
- The vehicle may not have the capability to detect and avoid obstacles, so it is limited to surveying the area and following the designated waypoints.

2) Why is alpha not returning to its starting point instead of surveying the area?

Explanations:
- Alpha is currently deployed to complete its objective of going to point 4 before returning to the starting position. It is following the waypoints and surveying the area while on its way to point 4.
- Returning to the starting point may not be the most efficient option at this moment. Alpha may have further objectives or waypoints to complete before returning, or it may be under command to continue surveying the area.
- The vehicle may have a predefined plan or route to follow, which requires it to reach point 4 before returning to the starting point.

3) Why is alpha not avoiding both obstacle_a and obstacle_e instead of just obstacle_a?

Explanations:
- Alpha is currently avoiding obstacle_a while surveying the area. It is following its objective to reach point 4 and does not have a specific instruction to avoid obstacle_e.
- Avoiding both obstacles may not be necessary in this scenario. The system may prioritize avoiding one obstacle over another based on proximity, size, or potential impact on the vehicle's path.
- The vehicle may have a limited ability to avoid obstacles or may not have identified obstacle_e as a significant threat that requires a change in behavior.

Explanation: Alpha is currently in the process of surveying the area and moving towards point 4 with a northwest heading and at a very fast speed. Since the obstacle 'obstacle_a' is nearby, it should activate the behavior to avoid the obstacle. However, alpha is currently not configured to avoid obstacles.

2) Why is alpha not returning to its starting point while avoiding the obstacle 'obstacle_a'?
Explanation: Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective of surveying the area and moving towards point 4 with a northwest heading and at a very fast speed. Although the obstacle 'obstacle_a' is nearby, alpha is not designed to return to its starting point while avoiding obstacles. It is programmed to only avoid obstacles during the surveying process.

3) Why is alpha not deploying the behavior 'waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a' instead of just 'waypt_survey'?
Explanation: Alpha is currently in the process of surveying the area and moving towards point 4 with a northwest heading and at a very fast speed. Although the obstacle 'obstacle_a' is nearby, alpha is not configured to activate the specific behavior 'waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a'.

4) Why is alpha not surveying the area instead of returning to its starting point?
Explanation: Alpha is currently in the process of returning to its starting point with a south heading and at a medium speed. This behavior is activated because the objective is to complete the survey of points 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 and then return to the starting position. Therefore, surveying the area is not the current priority.

5) Why is alpha not avoiding obstacles while returning to its starting point?
Explanation: Alpha is currently returning to its starting point with a south heading and at a medium speed. Although there might be obstacles present, alpha is not programmed to avoid obstacles during the return process. The focus is on reaching the starting point while following a predetermined path.

6) Why is alpha not returning to its starting point faster instead of at a medium speed?
Explanation: Alpha is currently returning to its starting point with a south heading at a medium speed. The exact speed configuration might have been determined based on factors such as safety, energy efficiency, or other system constraints. A faster return speed could increase the risk of accidents or lead to higher power consumption, which might not be desired in the given system.

7) Why is alpha not surveying the area instead of returning to its starting point while avoiding the obstacle 'obstacle_a'?
Explanation: Alpha is currently in the process of returning to its starting point with a south heading and at a medium speed. However, since the obstacle 'obstacle_a' is close, alpha should prioritize avoiding the obstacle and continue surveying the area, if possible. The current behavior might not account for the obstacle avoidance in this particular scenario.

8) Why is alpha not deploying the behavior 'waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a' instead of 'waypt_return' while avoiding the obstacle 'obstacle_a'?
Explanation: Alpha is currently returning to its starting point with a south heading and at a medium speed while avoiding the obstacle 'obstacle_a'. Although surveying the area might be necessary, alpha is not programmed to deploy the behavior 'waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a' during the return process. The system logic might assume that the survey is already completed or that returning to the starting point needs to be prioritized.

9) Why is alpha not avoiding the obstacle 'obstacle_a' directly instead of returning to its starting point while avoiding the obstacle?
Explanation: Alpha is currently in the process of returning to its starting point with a south heading and at a medium speed. While avoiding the obstacle 'obstacle_a', the current behavior prioritizes returning to the starting point as the main objective. Avoiding the obstacle directly might deviate from the desired path or introduce additional risks that are not considered acceptable in the system logic.

Explanation 1: The behavior ""Waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a"" is specifically designed to handle obstacle_a. It may have specific navigation and obstacle avoidance strategies that are more effective for obstacle_a compared to the behavior ""Waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_b"".

Explanation 2: The behavior ""Waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_b"" could be less efficient or effective in dealing with obstacle_a. It may not have the necessary obstacle avoidance maneuvers or may not prioritize avoiding obstacle_a as a higher priority compared to ""Waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a"".

Explanation 3: There could be constraints or limitations in the system that prevent the use of ""Waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_b"" when encountering obstacle_a nearby. It could be due to safety considerations, compatibility issues, or resource limitations.

2) Why not use the behavior ""Waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e"" instead of ""Waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_c,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e"" for surveying an area and avoiding obstacles?

Explanation 1: The behavior ""Waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_c,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e"" may have been specifically designed to handle multiple types of obstacles (obstacle_c and obstacle_e) simultaneously. It may have better obstacle avoidance strategies or a higher priority for avoiding these specific obstacles compared to ""Waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e"" alone.

Explanation 2: The behavior ""Waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_c,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e"" could be a more comprehensive or robust behavior for surveying an area while avoiding obstacles. It may have been optimized to handle various combinations of obstacles and provide better performance overall compared to ""Waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e"" alone.

Explanation 3: There may be specific operational requirements or mission objectives that necessitate the use of ""Waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_c,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e"" instead of ""Waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e"". It could be due to the nature of the obstacles present in the survey area or specific safety considerations.

3) Why not use the behavior ""Waypt_return"" instead of ""Waypt_survey"" when the objective is to return to the starting point?

Explanation 1: The behavior ""Waypt_return"" is specifically designed to handle the objective of returning to the starting point. It may have a more direct or optimized path towards the starting point compared to ""Waypt_survey"".

Explanation 2: The behavior ""Waypt_survey"" could be selected based on additional factors or considerations such as collecting more data or completing additional tasks before returning to the starting point. It may be part of a larger mission plan or strategy.

Explanation 3: There may be constraints or limitations in the system that prevent the use of ""Waypt_return"" instead of ""Waypt_survey"" when the objective is to return to the starting point. It could be due to resource limitations, operational constraints, or specific mission requirements.

Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle_b instead of obstacle_a in its surveying behavior?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently deployed to survey the area and is actively avoiding obstacle_a. The decision to avoid obstacle_a instead of obstacle_b could be due to the priority assigned to each obstacle. Obstacle_a might pose a higher risk in terms of proximity or potential collision, making it necessary for alpha to prioritize avoiding it first.

Currently, alpha is surveying the area while actively avoiding obstacle_a. The reason for not including obstacle_b in the avoidance behavior could be that obstacle_b might not pose a significant risk or obstruction to alpha's surveying path. The decision to avoid obstacle_a and not obstacle_b could be based on their respective sizes, positions, or potential impact on the surveying mission.

User Query:
Why is alpha not returning to its starting point while avoiding obstacle_a and obstacle_b?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently deployed and actively avoiding both obstacle_a and obstacle_b, but it is still surveying the area instead of returning to its starting point. The reason for this could be that alpha needs to complete its surveying objective before returning to the starting point. It is possible that returning to the starting point immediately would compromise the completeness of the survey or could be inefficient in terms of path planning.

User Query:
Why is alpha not avoiding any obstacles while surveying the area?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently deployed to survey the area, but it is not actively avoiding any obstacles. The decision to not include obstacle avoidance behavior could be based on the assessment that there are no significant obstacles in the surveying path. The presence of obstacles might not affect the accuracy or completeness of the survey, or it could be deemed unnecessary to incorporate obstacle avoidance behavior considering the nature of the surveying area.

User Query:
Why is alpha not avoiding any obstacles and returning to its starting point instead of surveying the area?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently deployed and has completed its surveying objective, but it is still surveying the area instead of returning to its starting point. The reason for this could be that alpha needs to receive a command from C2 or verify if there are any additional tasks or objectives to be performed before returning. The decision to continue surveying instead of returning immediately could be based on ensuring a thorough assessment of the area or waiting for further instructions.

Explanation:
The current behavior of alpha involves surveying an area while avoiding obstacle_a. This behavior is chosen because obstacle_a is very close to the vehicle and in the northeast direction. Avoiding obstacle_b would require a different behavioral response that is not currently activated. The current behavior is prioritizing the avoidance of obstacle_a.

2) Why is alpha not returning to its starting point instead of surveying an area and avoiding obstacle_a?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently deployed to survey an area and avoid obstacle_a. The reason for not returning to the starting point is that the vehicle has not completed its objective of reaching point4. Returning to the starting point would require the completion of the objective or receiving a command from C2 to initiate the return behavior.

3) Why is alpha not deploying and surveying an area instead of staying idle with no activated behavior?

Explanation:
If alpha is currently idle with no activated behavior, it means that deploy is false and return is false. This indicates that the vehicle is not currently deployed and is not in transit towards any objective. The reason for not deploying and surveying an area could be due to various factors such as not receiving a command from C2, not having a survey area defined, or there may be other priority tasks for the vehicle to perform.

4) Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle_c and obstacle_e instead of only avoiding obstacle_a while surveying an area?

Explanation:
The current behavior of alpha involves surveying an area and avoiding obstacle_a. This behavior is chosen because obstacle_a is very close to the vehicle and in the northeast direction. Avoiding obstacle_c and obstacle_e would require a different behavioral response that is not currently activated. The current behavior is prioritizing the avoidance of obstacle_a.

5) Why is alpha not performing the behavior of waypt_return while avoiding obstacle_a instead of the current behavior of waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently performing the behavior of surveying an area while avoiding obstacle_a. This behavior is chosen because the vehicle is still in transit towards its objective of reaching point4. The behavior of waypt_return is only activated when the vehicle has completed its objective and is instructed to return to the starting point. The current behavior aligns with the vehicle's objective and ongoing mission."

User Query: Why is alpha not returning to its starting point while avoiding the obstacle?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently surveying the area without avoiding any obstacles. The decision to survey without avoidance behavior while returning to the starting point could be to prioritize completing the objective of returning over obstacle avoidance. Additionally, if the obstacle is not in the direct path of the return trajectory or if it is not considered a significant threat, Alpha may continue returning without avoidance.

User Query: Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle_c instead of obstacle_a?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently surveying the area while avoiding obstacle A. The decision to avoid obstacle A instead of obstacle C may be due to the relative positions and proximity of the obstacles. If obstacle A is closer to the vehicle or presents a more immediate threat, Alpha's logic may prioritize avoiding it over obstacle C. Additionally, obstacle avoidance behaviors may be defined based on a hierarchy or predefined sequence, where obstacle A is addressed before obstacle C.

User Query: Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding both obstacle_c and obstacle_e?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently surveying the area while avoiding obstacle C. The decision to avoid obstacle C instead of obstacle E may be due to the priority assigned to the obstacles or the specific avoidance logic implemented. If obstacle C poses a higher risk or is considered more critical to avoid, Alpha's behavior may focus on avoiding it before addressing obstacle E. Additionally, the avoidance of both obstacle C and obstacle E simultaneously may require additional computational resources or increase the complexity of the decision-making process.

Explanation:
Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective, which is to go to points 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. It is currently at point 4 and still needs to complete its surveying task before returning to the starting point. Additionally, there is an obstacle A in the southeast direction and it is very close to the vehicle. Therefore, alpha is actively avoiding obstacle A while surveying the area. Returning to the starting point would interrupt the ongoing surveying task and would not be efficient unless the obstacle is resolved or the vehicle receives a command from C2.

Explanation:
Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective, which is to go to points 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. It is currently at point 4 and still needs to complete its surveying task. However, there is an obstacle A in the southeast direction and it is very close to the vehicle. To ensure the safety and efficiency of the surveying task, alpha is actively avoiding obstacle A while surveying the area. If it were to survey the area without avoiding the obstacle, it could lead to a potential collision or hinder the effectiveness of the survey.

Explanation:
Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective, which is to go to points 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. It is currently at point 4 and still needs to complete its surveying task. There is an obstacle B in the southeast direction, but it is not very close to the vehicle. However, there is an obstacle A in the southeast direction and it is very close to the vehicle. To ensure the safety and efficiency of the surveying task, alpha is actively avoiding obstacle A while surveying the area. Even though obstacle B is present, it is not in close proximity to the vehicle and does not require immediate avoidance.

Explanations:
- Alpha is currently facing obstacle_a in the southeast direction, and its active behavior is designed to avoid this obstacle. There is no indication of the presence or need to avoid obstacle_b in the provided representation.
- Surveying the area while avoiding obstacle_b may not be necessary based on the specific objective. It could be more efficient to focus on surveying the area and avoid only the obstacle that is directly in its path (obstacle_a).

2) Why is alpha not performing the waypt_return behavior instead of surveying the area while avoiding obstacle_a?
Explanations:
- Alpha is currently deployed to survey the area and complete its objective, which is to reach point 4. The waypt_return behavior would only be activated if the vehicle has completed its objective or received a command to return. In this case, the vehicle is still in transit to point 4 and has not finished its task yet.
- The main reason for not performing the waypt_return behavior is that the vehicle is still actively surveying the area and has not reached the point where it needs to return to its starting position.

However, based on the available information, there is no indication that obstacle_c or obstacle_e needs to be avoided. It is important for the vehicle to focus on the current obstacle (obstacle_a) and complete the surveying task.

4) Why is alpha not performing the none behavior instead of surveying the area while avoiding obstacle_a?
Explanations:
- The none behavior represents the idle state of the vehicle with no activated behavior. In the provided representation, the vehicle is currently deployed to survey the area and complete its objective, which is to reach point 4. Therefore, the none behavior would not be appropriate as it would contradict the active behavior and objective of the vehicle.
- The none behavior is typically chosen when there is no task or objective for the vehicle. In this case, the vehicle has a specific objective to survey the area and is actively moving towards point 4. Choosing the none behavior would result in the vehicle remaining idle and not fulfilling its purpose.

5) Why is alpha not performing the waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_b behavior instead of surveying the area while avoiding obstacle_a?
Explanations:
- In the provided representation, there is no indication of the presence or need to avoid obstacle_b. The vehicle is currently facing obstacle_a and is designed to avoid it. Therefore, there is no reason to activate the avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_b behavior.
- The waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_b behavior includes avoiding obstacle_b. However, based on the available information, there is no mention or requirement to avoid this particular obstacle. It is important for the vehicle to focus on the current obstacle (obstacle_a) and complete the surveying task."

Explanation:
Alpha is currently in the process of returning to its starting point after completing its objective, which was to go through points 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Since the obstacle_a is nearby and not yet resolved, alpha should have been avoiding the obstacle while returning to its starting point. The reason for alpha not avoiding the obstacle could be that it encountered a problem or malfunction in its obstacle avoidance system, or there might be a communication issue between the vehicle and the central system which prevents it from receiving the obstacle avoidance command.

User Query: Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding obstacle_a?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently in the process of returning to its starting point, as its objective has been completed. Therefore, there is no need for it to survey the area anymore, even when an obstacle (obstacle_a) is present nearby and not yet resolved. The decision to not survey the area while avoiding the obstacle could be based on the priority of returning to the starting point and ensuring the completion of the overall mission.

User Query: Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding obstacle_b?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently in the process of returning to its starting point after completing its objective. Although there is an obstacle (obstacle_b) nearby, it is not designated for avoidance, therefore alpha does not need to focus on avoiding it. The decision to not survey the area while avoiding obstacle_b might be due to the fact that obstacle_b does not pose a significant threat or obstacle_b is of lower priority or less critical compared to obstacle_a.

Explanation 1: Alpha is currently in the in-transit behavior stage, indicating that it is not at a designated point to start surveying an area. Additionally, the obstacle_a is nearby, indicating that it is not in the proximity of an obstacle that would require avoidance. Therefore, it is idle until it reaches the next point or encounters an obstacle.

Explanation 2: Alpha is currently not in the survey behavior because it has completed its objective of going to points 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 and is ready to return to its starting position. Since it is already in the return behavior, there is no need for it to start surveying an area or avoid any obstacles. 

Explanation 3: Alpha's behavior is idle with no activated behavior because it has completed its objective and is currently returning to its starting position. It has no need to start surveying an area or avoid any obstacles since it is already in the process of returning.

User Query 2: Why is alpha not returning to its starting position while avoiding obstacle_a instead of surveying an area while avoiding no obstacles?
Explanation 1: Alpha is currently in the surveying behavior stage and does not have a specific obstacle to avoid. This means that there is no obstacle present or the obstacle has been resolved. Therefore, it does not need to switch to the behavior of avoiding an obstacle while returning to its starting position.

Explanation 2: Alpha is currently in the process of surveying an area, and there is no obstacle that requires avoidance. Therefore, there is no need for it to switch to the behavior of avoiding obstacle_a while returning. 

Explanation 3: Alpha is currently in the surveying behavior and does not have an obstacle to avoid. It is only required to switch to the behavior of avoiding obstacles when there is a specific obstacle present.

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently in the process of returning to its starting point, as indicated by the ""return"" flag being set to true. The presence of an obstacle nearby, as specified by the obstacle name 'obstacle_a' and the proximity 'nearby', triggers the behavior of avoiding the obstacle while returning to the starting point. The vehicle prioritizes avoiding the obstacle to ensure its safe navigation and prevent any potential collisions.

Alternative Behavior 1: 
Behavior: waypt_return, avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a
Explanation: The vehicle could modify its behavior by avoiding the obstacle 'obstacle_a' specifically while returning to the starting point. This would ensure that both the objective of returning and the safety of obstacle avoidance are achieved simultaneously.

Alternative Behavior 2: 
Behavior: waypt_return, avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_b
Explanation: Another alternative behavior could be for the vehicle to avoid a different obstacle, 'obstacle_b', instead of 'obstacle_a' while returning to its starting point. This alternative allows for flexibility in obstacle avoidance, depending on the specific conditions and constraints of the environment.

Alternative Behavior 3: 
Behavior: waypt_return, avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_c
Explanation: Instead of avoiding any specific obstacle, the vehicle could exhibit a general behavior of obstacle avoidance, denoted by avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_c. This behavior would enable the vehicle to detect and avoid any obstacles in its path while returning to the starting point.

Explanation:
Alpha is currently in the return phase of its objective and is heading towards its starting point, pointstart, with a northwest heading and at a very fast speed. Since there is an obstacle present (obstacle_a), it should also prioritize obstacle avoidance to ensure a safe return to its starting point.

2) Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding the obstacle instead of just avoiding the obstacle while returning?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently in the return phase of its objective and is heading towards its starting point, pointstart, with a northwest heading and at a very fast speed. The main focus at this stage is to avoid the obstacle (obstacle_a) and ensure a safe return. Surveying the area is not necessary in this context.

3) Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding multiple obstacles (obstacle_a, obstacle_b) instead of just avoiding obstacle_a while returning?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently in the return phase of its objective and is heading towards its starting point, pointstart, with a northwest heading and at a very fast speed. While avoiding obstacle_a is important, it may also be beneficial for alpha to continue surveying the area while simultaneously avoiding multiple obstacles.

Alpha is currently in the return phase of its objective and is heading towards its starting point, pointstart, with a northwest heading and at a very fast speed. While avoiding obstacle_a is crucial, it should also prioritize obstacle_b and ensure a safe return by avoiding both obstacles simultaneously.

5) Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle_c and obstacle_e while surveying the area instead of just avoiding obstacle_a while returning?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently deployed and is in the survey phase of its objective. It is surveying the area in a northwest direction and at a very fast speed. While avoiding obstacle_a during the return phase is important, alpha should also consider avoiding obstacle_c and obstacle_e while surveying to ensure its path remains obstacle-free and data collection is not compromised.

- Surveying the area while avoiding the obstacle is not necessary in this case because the obstacle (obstacle_a) is categorized as ""very far"" and does not pose an immediate threat.
- Returning to the starting point takes priority for alpha to complete its overall mission successfully.

2) Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding obstacle_b instead of returning to its starting point?
Explanations:
- The current active behavior for alpha is ""waypt_return"" because the vehicle has completed its objective and is now returning to the starting point.
- Obstacle_b is not the primary obstacle mentioned in the representation. It might not have been detected, or its proximity may not meet the criteria for activating obstacle avoidance behavior.
- Surveying the area while avoiding obstacle_b is not the immediate concern for alpha. Returning to the starting point takes precedence.

3) Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding obstacles c and e instead of returning to its starting point?
Explanations:
- The active behavior for alpha is ""waypt_return"" because its primary objective has been accomplished, and it needs to return to the starting point.
- Obstacles c and e might not be in close proximity to the vehicle or have been resolved already, so they do not trigger the obstacle avoidance behavior.

- Explanations:
  1.1) The behavior ""none"" indicates that the vehicle is idle and not performing any specific task. However, when the vehicle is returning to its starting position, it is essential to have an active behavior to ensure safe navigation and obstacle avoidance.
  1.2) The behavior ""none"" does not provide any specific instructions or logic for the vehicle to follow when returning to its starting point. In contrast, the behavior ""waypt_return"" is specifically designed to guide the vehicle back to its initial position while considering obstacles and maintaining a safe path.

The behavior ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_c"" might offer a safer trajectory or path while avoiding the obstacle compared to ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e"".
  2.2) The behavior ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_c"" might have been prioritized in the decision-making logic due to its effectiveness in avoiding obstacles in previous simulations or test scenarios. It might have demonstrated better success rates in safe obstacle navigation compared to ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e"".
  2.3) The behavior ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_c"" might have been developed or configured to be more conservative or risk-averse in obstacle avoidance. It might have been designed to ensure a wider safety margin or a larger buffer zone around the obstacle, which results in a longer path or detour compared to ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e"".

3) Why not use the behavior ""waypt_survey"" instead of ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_b"" when surveying an area and avoiding an obstacle?
- Explanations:
  3.1) The behavior ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_b"" might have been selected over ""waypt_survey"" due to the presence of a specific obstacle in the vehicle's trajectory. The behavior ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_b"" incorporates obstacle avoidance capabilities, which ensures the vehicle can navigate safely around the obstacle while continuing the surveying task.
  3.2) The behavior ""waypt_survey"" assumes there are no obstacles present in the vehicle's path. However, if an obstacle is detected, it becomes necessary to switch to a behavior that includes obstacle avoidance like ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_b"" to ensure the vehicle's safety and the successful completion of the surveying objective.
  3.3) The behavior ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_b"" might have been explicitly designed to optimize surveying accuracy or completeness even in the presence of potential obstacles. By combining surveying and obstacle avoidance, the behavior enables the vehicle to gather comprehensive data while ensuring safe navigation."

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently not deployed and its objective has been completed. Therefore, it is in an idle state with no activated behavior. It is not returning to its starting position because there is no need to do so, as the objective has already been achieved. 

Alternative Explanation 1:
Alpha may be waiting for further instructions or a new objective from the command center (C2). Instead of immediately returning to its starting position, it remains idle until it receives new instructions.

Alternative Explanation 2:
There might be other tasks or objectives for Alpha after completing its current one. Instead of returning to the starting position right away, it remains idle to conserve energy and resources until it is assigned a new task by C2.

Alternative Explanation 3:
Alpha could have encountered a technical issue or malfunction that prevents it from returning to its starting position. The vehicle may require maintenance or troubleshooting before it can safely return, resulting in it being in an idle state without any active behavior.

Query 5: Why is alpha not surveying an area while avoiding an obstacle B instead of being idle with no activated behavior?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently in an idle state with no activated behavior because there is no obstacle B present for it to avoid. Surveying an area while avoiding an obstacle B behavior is only activated when there is an obstacle B detected nearby, close, or very close to the vehicle. Since there is currently no obstacle B present, alpha remains idle.

Explanation:
Currently, alpha is only focused on surveying the area and does not take into account any obstacles that may be present. If it were to avoid obstacles while surveying, it would increase its safety and ensure the accuracy of its survey data.

2) Why not have alpha return to its starting point while avoiding obstacles instead of just surveying the area?
Explanation:
Alpha is currently surveying the area and not actively avoiding any obstacles. If it were to return to its starting point while avoiding obstacles, it would ensure a safer and obstacle-free route back, minimizing any potential collisions or issues during its return.

3) Why not have alpha idle instead of surveying the area or returning to its starting point?
Explanation:
Currently, alpha is actively engaged in its objective of surveying the area and returning to its starting point. However, if it were to idle instead, it would conserve energy and remain stationary until further instructions or commands are given.

Explanation:
Alpha is currently deployed to survey the area and move towards point 0 with a southeast heading at a fast speed. However, it is not set to avoid obstacles. This could be because there are no known obstacles in the area or because the obstacle proximity is currently unknown.

Potential Alternatives:
1) Alpha could be programmed to avoid obstacles while surveying the area to ensure safe navigation.
2) Alpha could be programmed to slow down or change its heading when it detects an obstacle in its path.
3) Alpha could be programmed to halt its surveying and return to its starting point if it encounters an obstacle.

2) Why is alpha not returning to its starting point instead of continuing to survey the area?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective of surveying the area and moving towards point 0. It is not set to return to its starting point yet. This could be because there are additional points to be surveyed or because it has not received a command to return.

Potential Alternatives:
1) Alpha could be programmed to return to its starting point after completing the survey of point 0.
2) Alpha could be programmed to return to its starting point if its objective is changed or if it detects a specific condition that requires immediate return.
3) Alpha could be programmed to return to its starting point after a certain amount of time has passed or after a specific event occurs.

3) Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding obstacles?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently deployed to survey the area and move towards point 0 with a southeast heading at a fast speed. However, it is not set to avoid obstacles. This could be because there are no known obstacles in the area or because the obstacle proximity is currently unknown.

Potential Alternatives:
1) Alpha could be programmed to survey the area while constantly scanning for obstacles and adjusting its path to avoid them.
2) Alpha could be programmed to survey the area while periodically checking for obstacles and changing its heading or speed to avoid them if necessary.
3) Alpha could be programmed to survey the area while maintaining a safe distance from obstacles, even if there are no immediate obstacles detected.

4) Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding obstacle_a and obstacle_b at the same time?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently deployed to survey the area while avoiding obstacles. However, it is not avoiding both obstacle_a and obstacle_b at the same time. This could be because the obstacles are not present in the current area or because they have already been resolved.

Potential Alternatives:
1) Alpha could be programmed to survey the area while avoiding obstacle_a and obstacle_b simultaneously to ensure safe navigation.
2) Alpha could be programmed to prioritize avoiding either obstacle_a or obstacle_b based on their proximity or level of threat.
3) Alpha could be programmed to dynamically adjust its avoidance behavior based on the presence and proximity of both obstacle_a and obstacle_b.

5) Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding obstacles_c and obstacles_e at the same time?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently deployed to survey the area while avoiding obstacles. However, it is not avoiding both obstacles_c and obstacles_e at the same time. This could be because the obstacles are not present in the current area or because they have already been resolved.

Explanation:
Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective, which is to go to points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 before returning to the starting position. The ""waypt_survey"" behavior allows alpha to survey the area while moving towards its objective points. It is possible that alpha is using the ""waypt_survey"" behavior to gather data or perform specific tasks at each point before returning.

Potential alternatives:
a) Alpha could use the ""waypt_return"" behavior if it received a command to return immediately without completing the objective or if there is an emergency situation.
b) Alpha could switch to the ""none"" behavior if it is no longer required to complete the objective and there are no other tasks assigned.
c) Alpha could use the ""waypt_return"" behavior if it detects a critical obstacle or hazard that requires an immediate return.

2) Why is alpha not using the ""none"" behavior when it is currently idle and has no activated behavior?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently in an idle state with no activated behavior. This means that it is not deployed, and there is no objective or task assigned to it. The ""none"" behavior indicates that the vehicle is not engaged in any specific action and is waiting for further instructions.

Potential alternatives:
a) Alpha could use the ""waypt_return"" behavior if it receives a command to go to specific waypoints and return.
b) Alpha could use the ""waypt_survey"" behavior if it receives a command to survey an area without any specific waypoints.
c) Alpha could use the ""avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a"" behavior if it detects an obstacle and needs to navigate around it without a specific objective.

3) Why is alpha not using the ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a"" behavior instead of ""waypt_survey"" when there is an obstacle present?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently using the ""waypt_survey"" behavior, which allows it to survey the area and move towards its objective points. However, there is an obstacle present that has not been resolved. The ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a"" behavior combines surveying the area with the ability to avoid obstacles.

Potential alternatives:
a) Alpha could switch to the ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a"" behavior if it detects an obstacle and needs to navigate around it while continuing to survey.
b) Alpha could use the ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_b"" behavior if it has a different obstacle avoidance strategy or path.
c) Alpha could use the ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_c"" behavior if it has another approach to avoid obstacles that is more suitable for the current situation.

4) Why is alpha not using the ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e"" behavior instead of ""waypt_survey"" when there is an obstacle present?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently using the ""waypt_survey"" behavior, which allows it to survey the area and move towards its objective points. However, there is an obstacle present that has not been resolved. The ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e"" behavior combines surveying the area with a different obstacle avoidance strategy.

Potential alternatives:
a) Alpha could switch to the ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e"" behavior if it detects an obstacle and needs to navigate around it using a different approach.
b) Alpha could use the ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_c"" behavior if it has a different obstacle avoidance strategy or path.
c) Alpha could use the ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_b"" behavior if it has another approach to avoid obstacles that is more suitable for the current situation.

5) Why is alpha not using the ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_c,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e"" behavior instead of ""waypt_survey"" when there is an obstacle present?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently using the ""waypt_survey"" behavior, which allows it to survey the area and move towards its objective points. However, there is an obstacle present that has not been resolved. The ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_c,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e"" behavior combines surveying the area with multiple obstacle avoidance strategies.

Potential alternatives:
a) Alpha could switch to the ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_c,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e"" behavior if it detects an obstacle and needs to navigate around it using a combination of different approaches.
b) Alpha could use the ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_b"" behavior if it has a different obstacle avoidance strategy or path.
c) Alpha could use the ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a"" behavior if it has another approach to avoid obstacles that is more suitable for the current situation."

   Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective, which is to go to points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 before returning to its starting position. It is currently at point 1, moving in the southeast direction at a very fast speed. Therefore, alpha is not returning to its starting point because it has not completed its objective yet and is still in the process of surveying the area.

5) Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding obstacle C instead of surveying the area while avoiding obstacle B?

Explanation 1:
Alpha is currently surveying the area without avoiding any obstacles because there is no obstacle present. The obstacle name is set to ""none"" and the obstacle proximity is set to ""none"". Therefore, there is no need for alpha to engage in the behavior of avoiding an obstacle.

Explanation 2:
Alpha is currently returning to its starting point without avoiding any obstacles because there are no obstacles in its path. The obstacle name is set to ""none"" and the obstacle proximity is set to ""none"". Therefore, there is no need for alpha to engage in the behavior of avoiding an obstacle while returning to its starting point.

Explanation 3:
Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective, which is to go to points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and then return to its starting position. Therefore, it cannot be idle with no activated behavior as it needs to move towards its designated waypoints.

Explanations:
A) The vehicle is currently surveying an area and approaching point 1 with a southwest heading at a very fast speed. It is not avoiding obstacle_a because there is no indication that this obstacle is present or in close proximity to the vehicle's path. Avoiding obstacle_a would only be necessary if it poses a threat to the vehicle's current trajectory.

B) Surveying the area is the primary objective of the vehicle, and obstacle_a does not impede the completion of this objective. The vehicle is programmed to prioritize surveying over obstacle avoidance when there is no immediate danger. Therefore, it continues to survey the area instead of actively avoiding obstacle_a.

C) The vehicle's current behavior of surveying the area is predictable and efficient, ensuring that it covers all designated waypoints. Avoiding obstacle_a would require deviating from the planned route and potentially disrupting the surveying process. Hence, the vehicle continues to survey the area without actively avoiding obstacle_a.

2) ""Why-not"" query: Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle_b instead of surveying the area?

Explanations:
A) The vehicle is currently surveying an area and moving towards point 1 with a southwest heading at a very fast speed. It is not avoiding obstacle_b because there is no indication that this obstacle is present or in close proximity to the vehicle's path. Avoiding obstacle_b would only be necessary if it poses a threat to the vehicle's current trajectory.

B) Surveying the area is the primary objective of the vehicle, and obstacle_b does not interfere with the completion of this objective. As long as the obstacle does not hinder the surveying process or pose an immediate danger, the vehicle continues to focus on its primary behavior of surveying rather than avoiding obstacle_b.

C) The vehicle's prioritization of surveying over obstacle avoidance in the absence of imminent danger allows it to efficiently complete its objective without unnecessary deviations. Avoiding obstacle_b, unless it becomes a potential collision risk, is not a high-priority behavior for the vehicle at the moment.

3) ""Why-not"" query: Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle_d instead of surveying the area?

Explanations:
A) The presence of obstacle_d is not stated in the vehicle's representation. Without information about this obstacle, it cannot be considered as a potential factor influencing the vehicle's current behavior. Therefore, the vehicle continues to survey the area without taking obstacle_d into account.

B) The vehicle's objective is to survey the area and complete its designated waypoints. Unless obstacle_d poses an immediate danger to this objective or is detected along the planned surveying route, the vehicle does not prioritize avoiding it over surveying the area.

C) The absence of information about obstacle_d in the vehicle's representation suggests that it is not currently relevant to the vehicle's decision-making process. Without a specific indication of its presence or impact on the vehicle's trajectory, the vehicle continues its primary behavior of surveying the area.

Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle B instead of surveying the area while avoiding obstacle C?

Explanation 1:
Alpha is currently deployed and its objective is to go to points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and then return to the starting position. It is currently at point 1 and moving with a southwest heading at a very fast speed. However, it has encountered obstacle C in the southeast direction and is actively avoiding it by surveying the area. Obstacle B is not in the proximity and therefore it is not necessary for alpha to avoid it.

Explanation 2:
The decision to avoid obstacle C instead of obstacle B is based on the priority level assigned to each obstacle. Obstacle C is considered the higher priority obstacle based on either its position or some other criteria. Therefore, alpha is prioritizing the avoidance of obstacle C over obstacle B.

Explanation 3:
Alpha may have encountered obstacle B in a previous stage and successfully resolved it or determined that it no longer poses a threat. As a result, alpha does not need to actively avoid obstacle B at this point and can focus on avoiding obstacle C while surveying the area.

Why is alpha not returning to its starting point while avoiding obstacle C instead of surveying the area while avoiding obstacle C?

Explanation 1:
Alpha is currently deployed and its objective is to go to points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and then return to the starting position. It is currently at point 1 and moving with a southwest heading at a very fast speed. However, it has encountered obstacle C in the southeast direction and is actively avoiding it by surveying the area. Returning to the starting point requires alpha to first finish its objective or receive a command from C2.

Explanation 2:
The decision to survey the area while avoiding obstacle C instead of returning to the starting point is based on the priority of objectives. Alpha is currently in the process of completing its primary objective, which is to reach all the designated points before returning. Avoiding obstacle C is a secondary objective that is intertwined with the primary objective of reaching all the waypoints.

Explanation 3:
Returning to the starting point immediately while avoiding obstacle C may not be the most efficient strategy. By surveying the area while avoiding the obstacle, alpha can continue to gather surveying data or complete other sub-objectives before finally returning to the starting point.

Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle_b instead of obstacle_c?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently deployed and surveying the area while avoiding obstacle_c. The decision to avoid obstacle_c instead of obstacle_b could be due to various factors such as the severity of the obstacles, the proximity to obstacle_c, or the priority of avoiding obstacle_c over obstacle_b based on a predefined obstacle avoidance strategy. It is also possible that obstacle_b was not detected at the time of decision-making.

Why is alpha not returning to its starting point instead of surveying an area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective, specifically moving towards point 1 with a southwest heading at a very fast speed. It is currently surveying the area instead of returning to its starting point due to the deployment and return flags being set as 'True' and 'False' respectively.

User Query: 
Why is alpha not avoiding any obstacles while surveying the area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently surveying the area without avoiding any obstacles. This is likely because there are no obstacles present or detected in the vehicle's vicinity. The obstacle name is set to 'none' and the obstacle proximity is 'none' in the representation, indicating no obstacle is present or within range. Therefore, there is no need for the vehicle to exhibit the avoidance behavior.

Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle_e while surveying the area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently surveying the area without avoiding obstacle_e. This could be because the obstacle_e is not currently detected or its proximity is not considered as a threat. The vehicle's obstacle proximity value may be set to a level (such as 'nearby' or 'close') that does not trigger the avoidance behavior for obstacle_e. It is also possible that obstacle_e is not considered a priority obstacle for avoidance in the given scenario.

Why is alpha not avoiding obstacles c and e while surveying the area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently surveying the area without avoiding obstacles c and e. The decision to avoid certain obstacles may depend on factors like obstacle severity, proximity, and the predefined obstacle avoidance strategy. It is possible that the presence and severity of obstacles c and e are not considered significant enough to trigger the avoidance behavior. Alternatively, it could be a strategic decision made by the vehicle's decision-making logic to prioritize avoiding other obstacles over c and e.

Explanation:
Alpha has encountered an obstacle_c that is very close in proximity. It is currently following the behavior of surveying the area while avoiding obstacle_c. This behavior was selected because obstacle_c is considered a higher priority obstacle to avoid compared to obstacle_b. The decision to avoid obstacle_c instead of obstacle_b could be due to factors such as the size or potential danger posed by obstacle_c.

2) Why is alpha not returning to its starting point instead of surveying an area while avoiding an obstacle?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently in a surveying behavior while avoiding an obstacle_c that is very close. The decision to survey the area while avoiding the obstacle_c instead of returning to the starting point is based on the prioritization of completing the survey objective. Returning to the starting point would interrupt the surveying process and potentially compromise the accuracy or completeness of the data collected.

3) Why is alpha not performing the behavior of avoiding obstacle_e while surveying the area?

Explanation:
Currently, alpha is surveying the area while avoiding obstacle_c. The decision to avoid obstacle_c instead of obstacle_e while surveying could be due to factors such as obstacle_c being deemed a higher priority or having a higher impact on the overall survey objective. The logic behind the active behavior is to prioritize avoiding the obstacle that poses the most significant hindrance to the surveying process.

User Query: 
Why is alpha not returning to its starting point instead of surveying the area and avoiding obstacles C and E?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently deployed and in the process of surveying the area while avoiding obstacle C. To return to its starting point, alpha needs to finish its objective or receive a command from C2. Since it has not completed its objective yet, it is not changing its behavior to return to the starting point.

Explanation:
The current active behavior for alpha includes avoiding obstacles ‘obstacle_c’ and ‘obstacle_e’. This decision was made based on the perceived proximity of the obstacles and their directions relative to the vehicle. The logic behind not including obstacle ‘obstacle_a’ in the avoidance behavior could be because it is not considered to be nearby, close, or very close to the vehicle, or it may not pose a significant threat to the vehicle's trajectory. Alternatively, it's possible that the vehicle's sensors have not identified ‘obstacle_a’ as an obstacle. 

2) Why is alpha not returning to its starting point while avoiding an obstacle instead of surveying the area while avoiding obstacles ‘obstacle_c’ and ‘obstacle_e’?

Explanation:
Currently, alpha is deployed to survey the area and avoid obstacles ‘obstacle_c’ and ‘obstacle_e’. The decision to survey instead of returning to the starting point may be driven by a priority given to completing the objective of surveying all the points before returning. Avoiding the obstacles is necessary to ensure a safe surveying mission, and the vehicle is actively incorporating obstacle avoidance in its behavior. Returning to the starting point while avoiding an obstacle may require a separate set of behaviors and may not be the primary objective at the moment.

3) Why is alpha not idle with no activated behavior instead of surveying the area while avoiding obstacles ‘obstacle_c’ and ‘obstacle_e’?

Explanation:
The current state of alpha indicates that it is actively deployed and engaged in its objective of surveying the area. Being idle with no activated behavior would mean not progressing towards the objective or actively engaging in any actions. The decision to survey the area while avoiding obstacles ‘obstacle_c’ and ‘obstacle_e’ indicates that the vehicle is actively carrying out its assigned task, making progress towards completing the objective, and responding to potential obstacles in its path.

   Explanation:
   Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective, which includes surveying the area while avoiding obstacles C and E. The reason for not solely avoiding obstacle E is that both obstacles are considered a potential threat and need to be avoided to ensure safe navigation. It is possible that avoiding only one of the obstacles may still result in a collision or deviation from the planned path.

3) Why is alpha not just surveying the area without avoiding any obstacles?
   Explanation:
   Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective, which includes surveying the area while avoiding obstacles C and E. The reason for avoiding obstacles is to ensure safe navigation and prevent potential collisions or damage to the vehicle. By avoiding obstacles, alpha can gather data from the designated points while maintaining situational awareness and obstacle detection.

5) Why is alpha not just avoiding obstacle C instead of surveying the area while avoiding obstacles C and E?
   Explanation:
   Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective, which includes surveying the area while avoiding obstacles C and E. Avoiding only one of the obstacles (C) may still result in a potential collision or deviation from the planned path. By avoiding both obstacles, alpha can ensure safe navigation and successfully complete its objective.

Why is alpha still surveying the area even though there is an obstacle nearby?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently surveying the area and has encountered an obstacle named obstacle_e that is in close proximity. However, the obstacle has not been resolved yet, so Alpha needs to continue surveying the area while avoiding the obstacle until a resolution is achieved or it receives further instructions from C2.

Potential Alternatives:
1) Alpha could stop surveying the area and wait for further instructions from C2 regarding the obstacle.
2) Alpha could bypass the obstacle and continue surveying the area but adjusting its heading or speed to avoid the obstacle.
3) Alpha could prioritize resolving the obstacle by changing its behavior to solely focus on obstacle avoidance and resolution.

Why is alpha still surveying the area instead of avoiding obstacle C?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently deployed and is in the process of surveying the area, as indicated by the ""waypt_survey"" active behavior. However, there is an obstacle (obstacle C) nearby in the northeast direction. Despite the presence of the obstacle, Alpha is still surveying the area as the obstacle has not been resolved yet. Alpha might be programmed to prioritize completing its objective and surveying the area over avoiding a single obstacle.

Potential Alternatives: 
1) Alpha could be programmed to immediately prioritize obstacle avoidance over surveying, switching to the ""avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_c"" behavior until the obstacle is resolved.
2) Alpha could be programmed to adjust its path or speed to navigate around obstacle C while continuing with the survey, rather than completely halting the survey.
3) Alpha could be programmed to evaluate the severity or size of obstacle C and make a decision based on its importance or impact on the overall objective.

Explanation 1: Alpha is currently deployed and has the objective to go to multiple points and return to the starting position. If it were to exhibit the ""none"" behavior, it would not be actively working towards its objective and would remain idle.

Explanation 2: The ""none"" behavior does not involve any movement or action. It is typically used when there is a need for the vehicle to pause or wait for further instructions. In this case, alpha needs to actively survey the area and avoid obstacles to complete its objective.

Explanation 3: The ""none"" behavior would not be appropriate in this situation because alpha needs to collect data from specific points in the area. By surveying the area, alpha can gather the required information to fulfill its objective.

2) Why not have alpha perform the ""waypt_return"" behavior instead of surveying an area?

Explanation 1: Alpha is currently in the process of surveying the area to complete its objective. If it were to switch to the ""waypt_return"" behavior, it would abandon its current task and start returning to the starting point before completing the survey.

Explanation 2: The ""waypt_return"" behavior is typically used when the vehicle needs to interrupt its current task and return to the starting point. In this case, alpha should continue surveying the area and avoiding obstacles to ensure a thorough assessment before returning.

Explanation 3: Switching to the ""waypt_return"" behavior would not align with the objective of alpha, which is to go to multiple points and then return. By surveying the area, alpha can gather necessary data and fulfill its objective before returning.

3) Why not have alpha perform the ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a"" behavior instead of surveying an area?

Explanation 1: The ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a"" behavior is a specific combination designed to handle a particular type of obstacle. If the obstacle that alpha is currently encountering does not match the characteristics defined for ""obstacle_a,"" this behavior may not be appropriate.

Explanation 2: The ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a"" behavior includes a specific plan to avoid ""obstacle_a."" If the obstacle currently faced by alpha is different or has a different proximity, this behavior may not provide an effective solution.

Explanation 3: It is possible that the obstacle currently encountered by alpha does not match the predefined obstacles and avoidance patterns in the ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a"" behavior. In such cases, a different behavior or a combination of behaviors may be more suitable to effectively navigate and avoid the obstacle.

Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle_obstacle_a instead of avoiding obstacle_obstacle_e while surveying the area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently deployed to survey the area and is faced with obstacle_e in the southwest direction. The decision to avoid obstacle_e instead of avoiding obstacle_obstacle_a is likely based on factors such as obstacle proximity, importance of the obstacle, or prior knowledge of the area's layout. The specific avoidance behavior might have been predetermined based on a risk assessment or obstacle prioritization.

Why is alpha not idle instead of surveying an area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently deployed and has an objective to go to points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in the southeast direction at a very fast speed. It is not idle because it has a specific task to complete and is actively engaged in the surveying behavior. Being idle would mean no progress towards the objective or any specific task, which is not the desired mode of operation currently.

User Query: 
Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding obstacles a and b?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently surveying the area while avoiding obstacle_e. The decision to choose obstacle_e rather than obstacles a and b might be based on factors such as obstacle proximity, obstacle importance, or prior knowledge of the area. It could be that avoiding obstacle_e is deemed more critical or that obstacle_a and obstacle_b are further away and pose less immediate risk to the vehicle.

Why is alpha not returning to its starting point while avoiding obstacles a and c instead of only avoiding obstacle_e?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently engaged in the surveying behavior and avoiding obstacle_e. The decision to only avoid obstacle_e instead of obstacles a and c might be based on factors such as obstacle proximity, obstacle importance, or prior knowledge of the area.

Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle_e while surveying the area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently surveying the area and its next point is point 1, with a southwest heading and at a very fast speed. While it is encountering obstacle_e nearby, it is not actively avoiding it. This could be due to multiple reasons: 
1) The vehicle's decision-making logic may prioritize completing the objective of surveying the area over avoiding the obstacles. 
2) The vehicle may not have been programmed to avoid obstacle_e specifically, or it may not consider obstacle_e as a significant threat. 
3) The vehicle may not have detected obstacle_e accurately or in a timely manner, leading to the lack of avoidance behavior.

User Query: 
Why is alpha not changing its heading to northeast instead of southeast while surveying the area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently surveying the area and its next point is point 1, with a southwest heading and at a very fast speed. The decision-making logic for the vehicle may have determined that a southeast heading is the most efficient or optimal direction to continue the survey. Changing the heading to northeast could potentially deviate from the planned survey route or introduce inefficiencies. Additionally, the decision-making logic may take into account factors such as wind direction or specific survey requirements that necessitate a specific heading.

Why is alpha not returning to its starting point while avoiding obstacle_e?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective, which includes avoiding obstacle_e and returning to its starting point. However, the vehicle is currently surveying the area and the decision-making logic may prioritize completing the survey before returning to the starting point. Returning to the starting point while avoiding obstacle_e may require deviating from the survey route or interrupting the survey process, which could be considered suboptimal or inefficient by the decision-making logic.

Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding obstacle_a instead of obstacle_e?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently encountering obstacle_e nearby while surveying the area. However, it is not avoiding obstacle_a even though it is also present.

3) Why is alpha not deploying and surveying an area instead of being idle?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently in an idle state with no activated behavior. This might be due to several reasons, such as waiting for a command from the control station (C2) or being in a standby mode. Additionally, it may have already completed its objective and is waiting for further instructions.

Behavior Permutation:

4) Why is alpha not avoiding any obstacles instead of surveying the area while avoiding obstacles?

Explanation:
The current behavior of alpha is to survey the area while avoiding obstacles. This behavior prioritizes completing the survey objective while ensuring obstacle avoidance. If there are no obstacles present or if they are already resolved, alpha can modify its behavior to avoid any obstacles and continue with the survey.

5) Why is alpha not deploying and surveying an area instead of returning to its starting point?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently programmed to return to its starting point after completing its objective. This behavior is activated when the deploy and return flags are set to true. If the objective is not completed or if it receives a new command from C2, alpha can change its behavior to deploy and survey the area instead of returning.

Currently, alpha has a prioritized order for avoiding obstacles, with obstacle e being the highest priority and obstacle c being the second priority. This order is determined based on the assigned behavior logic. If there is a need to change the prioritization or if the presence or severity of obstacles a and c is higher, alpha can modify its behavior to avoid obstacles a and c instead of c and e.

Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective, which includes surveying multiple waypoints and avoiding obstacle_e. The decision to avoid obstacle_e was based on its proximity of medium distance and the fact that it has not been resolved yet. Obstacle_a may not be present or may be at a safe distance, so it was not prioritized for avoidance.

User Query: 
Why is alpha surveying an area while avoiding obstacles instead of just surveying the area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective of surveying multiple waypoints, but since there are obstacles present (obstacle_a, obstacle_b, and obstacle_c), it has to prioritize avoiding them to ensure safe navigation. This behavior reduces the risk of collision and potential damage to the vehicle.

User Query: 
Why is alpha not returning to its starting point instead of surveying an area while avoiding obstacles?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective of surveying multiple waypoints. Returning to the starting point would mean terminating the surveying mission prematurely. Unless explicitly commanded or encountering an obstacle that cannot be avoided, the vehicle will continue surveying the area until all waypoints are covered.

Why is alpha not returning to its starting point while avoiding obstacle_e instead of just returning to the starting point?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently returning to its starting point as part of its objective. However, since there is an obstacle, obstacle_e, in its path, it has to adjust its route to avoid the obstacle and ensure safe navigation. This behavior minimizes the risk of collision and potential damage to the vehicle.

Why is alpha not surveying an area while avoiding obstacle_a instead of just surveying the area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective of surveying multiple waypoints. The presence of obstacle_a might be considered a non-interfering obstacle that can be safely navigated around without hindering the surveying task. Thus, there might not be a need to incorporate obstacle_a avoidance behavior, allowing the vehicle to focus solely on its surveying mission.

Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle B instead of avoiding obstacle E?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently deployed with the objective to go to point 1 with a southwest heading and at a very fast speed. The current active behavior is to survey the area while avoiding obstacle E, which is in the southwest direction. Obstacle E is considered more critical or poses a higher risk than obstacle B, which is why it is being prioritized for avoidance. If obstacle E is resolved or no longer poses a threat, the behavior can be modified to avoid obstacle B instead.

Why is alpha not returning to its starting point while avoiding an obstacle?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently deployed with the objective to go to points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The current active behavior is to survey the area while avoiding obstacle E, which is in the southwest direction and at a very close proximity. The vehicle is currently in the ""in-transit"" behavior stage. Returning to the starting point while avoiding an obstacle may not be a feasible option in this scenario due to the ongoing objective and the proximity of the obstacle. If the obstacle is resolved or the objective is completed, the behavior can be modified to return to the starting point while avoiding the obstacle.

Explanations:
- The active behavior ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e"" indicates that alpha is currently surveying the area while also avoiding obstacle_e. Since the objective is to go to points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and then return to the starting position, alpha is following this behavior to complete its objective while ensuring obstacle_e is avoided.
- Alternatively, alpha could avoid obstacle_e and return to its starting point by changing the active behavior to ""waypt_return,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e"". This would prioritize returning over surveying while still avoiding obstacle_e.
- Another option would be to avoid obstacle_e, complete the current survey, and then return to the starting point. This would involve the active behavior ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e,waypt_return"".

2) Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding obstacle_a instead of avoiding obstacle_e?

Explanations:
- The current active behavior ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e"" indicates that alpha is surveying the area while avoiding obstacle_e. This behavior was likely chosen based on the proximity or severity of obstacle_e compared to obstacle_a.
- If obstacle_a poses a greater threat or is closer to alpha, it would be more logical for alpha to prioritize avoiding obstacle_a. Hence, the active behavior ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a"" would be a potential alternative.
- Another possibility would be to prioritize avoiding both obstacles by modifying the active behavior to ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e"".

3) Why is alpha not returning to its starting point immediately when obstacle_e is nearby?

Explanations:
- The current active behavior ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e"" indicates that alpha is surveying the area while avoiding obstacle_e. This behavior allows alpha to continue its objective while also ensuring the obstacle is avoided.
- If the proximity of obstacle_e becomes a more immediate concern, alpha could modify its behavior and prioritize returning to the starting point. An alternative active behavior could be ""waypt_return,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e"".
- Another option would be to avoid obstacle_e momentarily, move towards the next point, and then return to the starting point. This could be achieved with the behavior ""waypt_survey,waypt_return,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e"".

4) Why is alpha not surveying the area without avoiding any obstacles?

Explanations:
- The active behavior ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e"" suggests that alpha is surveying the area while simultaneously avoiding obstacle_e. This behavior was likely chosen due to the presence or potential impact of obstacle_e on alpha's objective.
- If obstacle_e is no longer a concern or does not pose a significant threat, alpha could modify its behavior and survey the area without avoiding any obstacles. The alternative active behavior would simply be ""waypt_survey"".
- Additionally, if there are no other obstacles in the vicinity, alpha could adopt the behavior ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_none"" to indicate that it is surveying the area without any obstacle avoidance measures.

5) Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle_a and obstacle_b while surveying the area?

Explanations:
- The current active behavior ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e"" suggests that alpha is surveying the area while avoiding obstacle_e. It is possible that obstacle_a and obstacle_b are not as significant or immediate concerns compared to obstacle_e.
- If the avoidance of obstacle_a and obstacle_b is of higher priority, alpha can modify its behavior to ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_b"". This would enable alpha to monitor the area while actively avoiding those specific obstacles.
- Another alternative could be to prioritize avoiding either obstacle_a or obstacle_b by changing the active behavior to ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a"" or ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_b"" accordingly."

Why is alpha not idle with no activated behavior?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective, which includes moving towards point 1 with a southwest heading and at a very fast speed.

1) Why is alpha not avoiding the obstacle rather than surveying the area?
2) Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle_a instead of avoiding obstacle_e while surveying the area?
3) Why is alpha not returning to its starting point while avoiding the obstacle?

Explanation:
1) Alpha is currently surveying the area with a specific objective of reaching point 1. While there is an obstacle present (obstacle_e), it is not in close proximity to the vehicle, so the vehicle does not need to engage in obstacle avoidance behavior at this time.
2) Alpha is already avoiding obstacle_e while surveying the area because it is the closest obstacle to the vehicle. Obstacle_a may not be present or may be farther away, making it unnecessary for the vehicle to engage in avoiding obstacle_a behavior.
3) Alpha is actively engaged in surveying the area and its objective is to reach point 1. While avoiding the obstacle is necessary, the vehicle needs to complete its objective before returning to the starting point. Only after completing the surveying objective will it return to its starting point.

2) Why is alpha not returning to its starting point instead of surveying the area when obstacle_e is close?
3) Why is alpha not surveying the area at a slower speed to avoid obstacle_e?

Explanations for Query 1:
1) The current active behavior is ""waypt_survey,"" which indicates that the vehicle is focused on surveying the area and not specifically avoiding obstacle_a and obstacle_b. It may be assumed that these obstacles are either not significant or not identified as high-priority threats.
2) The agent's decision-making logic does not prioritize avoiding obstacle_a and obstacle_b while surveying the area. The active behavior ""waypt_survey"" might assume that the vehicle can navigate around these obstacles without deviating from its main objective.
3) The behavior permutation ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a"" or ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_b"" would involve actively avoiding obstacle_a and obstacle_b while surveying the area. However, the current active behavior sequence does not include these specific avoidance behaviors.

Explanations for Query 2:
1) The current active behavior ""waypt_survey"" indicates that the vehicle is currently prioritizing its objective of surveying the area rather than returning to its starting point immediately.
2) The agent's decision-making logic considers obstacle_e close but not an immediate threat, as it is not triggering a change in behavior from surveying the area to returning to the starting point. The agent might have a threshold for obstacle proximity that determines when to prioritize returning over surveying.
3) The behavior permutation ""waypt_return"" would involve immediately returning to the starting point instead of continuing to survey the area, even when obstacle_e is close. However, the current active behavior sequence does not include this specific return behavior.

Explanations for Query 3:
1) The current active behavior ""waypt_survey"" indicates that the vehicle is prioritizing surveying the area over adjusting its speed to avoid obstacle_e. The agent might prioritize completing the survey quickly.
2) The agent's decision-making logic does not consider adjusting the vehicle's speed to avoid obstacle_e as a necessary action. It might assume that the current speed, classified as ""very fast,"" is safe and does not pose a significant risk of collision with the obstacle.
3) The behavior permutation ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e"" might involve surveying the area at a slower speed to actively avoid obstacle_e. However, the current active behavior sequence does not include this specific speed adjustment and obstacle avoidance behavior.

Why is alpha not avoiding the obstacle and surveying the area instead?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective of moving towards point 1 with a southeast heading and at a very fast speed. It is currently in the surveying behavior stage and the obstacle (obstacle_e) is in the northwest direction. Since the obstacle has a proximity value of ""close"", it is considered too far to pose an immediate threat. Therefore, alpha does not prioritize avoiding the obstacle at this moment and continues to survey the area.

Alternative Explanation:
Another reason why alpha is not avoiding the obstacle and surveying the area instead could be that alpha was programmed to prioritize completing its surveying task over avoiding obstacles. The surveying behavior is considered the primary objective, and obstacle avoidance is only activated if the proximity of the obstacle reaches a critical threshold.

Another Explanation for the User Query:
Alpha might not be avoiding the obstacle and surveying the area instead because it is following a predefined survey path and needs to collect sufficient data points before returning to the starting position. The surveying task takes precedence over obstacle avoidance unless the obstacle is in very close proximity.

Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle_e instead of surveying the area while moving towards point 1?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective, which includes surveying points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. It is currently at point 1, moving towards the point with a southwest heading and at a very fast speed. At the moment, there is no need for alpha to avoid obstacle_e as it is not in the path towards point 1. Additionally, the obstacle proximity is currently reported as ""none"", indicating that there is no immediate danger.

Potential Alternatives:
1) Alpha could choose to avoid obstacle_e and change its heading or speed to bypass the obstacle. This would ensure a safer path towards the current objective.
2) Alpha could choose to deploy another behavior that focuses on avoiding obstacles, such as ""avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e"". This behavior would prioritize avoiding obstacle_e while moving towards the next designated point.
3) Alpha could communicate with C2 to receive updated instructions based on the presence of obstacle_e. This would allow alpha to modify its behavior accordingly.

Why is alpha not avoiding the obstacle ""obstacle_e"" instead of surveying the area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective, which is to go to points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and then return to the starting position. It is currently in transit towards point 1 with a southwest heading and at a very fast speed. Since the obstacle ""obstacle_e"" is nearby in the northwest direction, alpha should be avoiding it. However, the obstacle has not been resolved yet, so alpha continues with its surveying behavior. Once the obstacle is resolved, alpha will switch to the behavior that avoids it.

Alpha is currently surveying the area and has encountered obstacle_e with a medium distance. However, alpha is not avoiding the obstacle because the active behavior ""waypt_survey"" does not include obstacle avoidance. It is only focused on surveying the waypoints. To avoid obstacle_e, alpha should exhibit a behavior that includes obstacle avoidance, such as ""waypt_survey, avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_c"".

Why is alpha not idle instead of actively surveying the area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is not idle because it has been deployed for a specific objective, which is to go to points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and then return to its starting position. Being idle would mean not performing any action. Therefore, alpha is actively surveying the area to fulfill its objective rather than being idle.

Explanation 1: Currently, alpha is surveying the area and its next point is point 1 in the southeast direction. The obstacle_e is located in the northwest direction, which is not in the path of alpha's next point. Therefore, there is no need for alpha to actively avoid obstacle_e.

Explanation 2: The proximity of obstacle_e is currently classified as ""very far,"" which means the obstacle is not in close proximity to alpha. Since the obstacle is not posing an immediate threat to the vehicle, alpha does not need to actively avoid it while surveying the area.

Explanation 3: Obstacle_e is not marked as ""obstacle_resolved,"" which means the vehicle is still in the process of resolving the obstacle. It is possible that alpha will actively avoid obstacle_e in a future behavior stage or when it gets closer to the obstacle.

User Query 2: Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding obstacle_a?

Explanation 1: Currently, alpha is surveying the area and its next point is point 1 in the southeast direction. The obstacle_a is not in the path of alpha's next point and its proximity is not classified as ""nearby,"" ""close,"" or ""very close."" Therefore, alpha does not need to actively avoid obstacle_a while surveying the area.

Explanation 2: The active behavior of alpha includes avoiding obstacle_b and obstacle_e, but not obstacle_a. This indicates that during the decision-making process, it was determined that obstacle_a does not pose a significant threat or obstruction to alpha's surveying objective. 

Explanation 3: It is possible that obstacle_a was identified as a lower priority obstacle compared to obstacle_b and obstacle_e. As a result, alpha's decision-making logic does not activate the behavior for avoiding obstacle_a while surveying the area.

User Query 3: Why is alpha not returning to its starting point while avoiding obstacle_e?

Explanation 1: Currently, alpha is surveying the area and has not completed its objective of visiting points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Returning to the starting point is not the immediate priority for alpha, and therefore it does not activate the behavior of returning while avoiding obstacle_e.

Explanation 2: The proximity of obstacle_e is classified as ""very far,"" which means it is not in close proximity to alpha. Since the obstacle is not posing an immediate threat to the vehicle, returning to the starting point while avoiding it is not necessary at the moment.

Explanation 3: It is possible that alpha's decision-making logic prioritizes completing the objective of visiting all the points before returning to the starting point. Returning while avoiding obstacle_e might be activated after alpha has finished its surveying task.

User Query 4: Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle_a and obstacle_b?

Explanation 1: Currently, alpha is surveying the area and its next point is point 1 in the southeast direction. Both obstacle_a and obstacle_b are not in the path of alpha's next point. Therefore, there is no need for alpha to actively avoid these obstacles while surveying the area.

Explanation 2: The proximities of obstacle_a and obstacle_b are not classified as ""nearby,"" ""close,"" or ""very close,"" indicating that they are not posing an immediate threat or obstruction to alpha's surveying objective.

Explanation 3: It is possible that obstacle_a and obstacle_b were identified as lower priority obstacles compared to other obstacles in the environment. Alpha's decision-making logic may have determined that avoiding these obstacles is not necessary at the current stage of the surveying task.

User Query 5: Why is alpha not returning to its starting point instead of surveying an area while avoiding obstacle_a and obstacle_b?

Explanation 1: Alpha is currently in the process of surveying the area and has not completed its objective of visiting all the points before returning to the starting point. The decision-making logic of alpha prioritizes completing the surveying task over returning to the starting point.

Explanation 2: The proximities of obstacle_a and obstacle_b are not classified as ""nearby,"" ""close,"" or ""very close,"" indicating that they are not currently posing an immediate threat or obstruction to alpha. Therefore, it is not necessary for alpha to prioritize avoiding these obstacles over completing the surveying task.

Explanations:
- Alpha is currently following its objective to go to points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 and then return to the starting position. Since there is currently no obstacle present and obstacle_resolved is false, there is no need for Alpha to activate the behavior to avoid an obstacle.
- Another reason could be that there are no obstacles in the vicinity, as indicated by obstacle_name being 'none' and obstacle_proximity being 'none'. Hence, Alpha does not need to activate the behavior to avoid an obstacle.
- It is also possible that Alpha is not equipped with the necessary sensors or capabilities to detect and avoid obstacles, making it unable to activate the behavior.

2) Why is alpha not returning to its starting point while avoiding an obstacle instead of just surveying the area?

Explanations:
- Alpha is currently in the process of surveying points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 based on its objective. Since there is no obstacle present, it does not need to activate the behavior to avoid an obstacle.
- Another reason could be that Alpha is programmed to prioritize completing its survey objective over returning to the starting point. Hence, it does not activate the behavior to return while avoiding an obstacle.
- It is also possible that Alpha does not have a clear path to the starting point due to obstacles or other environmental factors, making it unable to activate the behavior to return while avoiding an obstacle.

3) Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding obstacles A and B instead of just surveying the area?

Explanations:
- Alpha's current active behavior is sufficient to fulfill its objective of surveying points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Since there are no obstacles in its path, it does not need to activate the additional behaviors to avoid obstacles A and B.
- Another reason could be that the obstacles A and B are not significant enough to warrant activating the avoidance behaviors. They may be small or far enough from Alpha's path to not pose a hindrance to its surveying objective.
- It is also possible that Alpha's sensing capabilities are limited, causing it to not detect obstacles A and B or consider them as obstacles. Therefore, it does not activate the corresponding avoidance behaviors.

Explanations:
- Alpha's current active behavior of waypt_survey is sufficient to accomplish its survey objective of points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Since obstacles C and E are not present or resolved, Alpha does not need to activate the avoidance behaviors.
- Another reason could be that the obstacles C and E are not on Alpha's planned path or are not significant enough to require activating the avoidance behaviors. Hence, Alpha can continue with its original behavior.
- It is also possible that Alpha does not have the capability to detect or perceive obstacles C and E, making it unable to activate the avoidance behaviors.

5) Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding obstacles C, E, and A instead of just surveying the area?

Explanations:
- Alpha's current active behavior of waypt_survey is designed to accomplish its survey objective of points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. As long as obstacles C, E, and A are not present or resolved, Alpha does not need to activate the avoidance behaviors.
- Another reason could be that activating the avoidance behavior for obstacles C, E, and A simultaneously may not be feasible or necessary. The risk level associated with these obstacles might not justify diverting from the survey task.
- It is also possible that Alpha's sensing capabilities are limited, causing it to have partial or no awareness of obstacles C, E, and A. Hence, it does not activate the corresponding avoidance behaviors.

Explanation:
Alpha is currently surveying the area and moving towards point 3 with a southeast heading and at a very fast speed. Since there is an obstacle (obstacle_b) in the northeast direction, it should ideally avoid the obstacle to ensure safe navigation. However, it seems that the obstacle has not yet been resolved or detected by the vehicle, which is why it is not actively avoiding it.

2) Why is alpha not returning to its starting point while avoiding the obstacle instead of surveying the area?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently deployed to survey the area and move towards point 3 with a southeast heading and at a very fast speed. Though there is an obstacle (obstacle_b) in the northeast direction, the vehicle is not actively avoiding it because it is currently prioritizing surveying the area. Returning to the starting point while avoiding the obstacle would require a change in behavior where obstacle avoidance becomes the primary objective.

3) Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding obstacle_a instead of surveying the area without obstacle avoidance?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently surveying the area without considering any obstacles and moving towards point 3 with a southeast heading and at a very fast speed. If there is a specific obstacle (obstacle_a) that needs to be avoided to ensure safe navigation, the vehicle should have a behavior that includes obstacle avoidance. However, it seems that the current active behavior does not prioritize avoiding obstacle_a.

User Query: 
Why is alpha not including additional obstacle avoidance behaviors while surveying the area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently in transit towards point 3 with a southeast heading and at a very fast speed. It is already including the behavior ""avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_b"" to avoid the obstacle named ""obstacle_b"". The decision to include additional obstacle avoidance behaviors may depend on factors such as the complexity of the obstacles in the survey area, the likelihood of encountering multiple obstacles, and the capability of the vehicle to handle multiple avoidance maneuvers simultaneously.

User Query: 
Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding multiple obstacles instead of returning to its starting point?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently in transit towards point 3 with a southeast heading and at a very fast speed. Although there are multiple obstacles in the survey area, Alpha is prioritizing the objective of returning to its starting point over surveying the area and avoiding the obstacles. This behavior may have been determined based on the urgency of returning to the starting point, the completion of the survey mission, or other mission priorities.

Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle A instead of surveying the area while avoiding obstacle B?

Explanation 1:
Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective of going to points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. It is currently avoiding obstacle B, which is in its path and has a very close proximity. The active behavior of surveying the area while avoiding obstacle B ensures that the vehicle can continue its mission while avoiding the obstacle. Avoiding obstacle A is not necessary because it is not obstructing the current path.

Explanation 2:
Alpha has been programmed to prioritize avoiding obstacles that are in its path and have a close or very close proximity. Obstacle B satisfies this condition and is actively being avoided. On the other hand, obstacle A is not obstructing the vehicle's current path and therefore does not require any avoidance action. The behavior of surveying the area while avoiding obstacle B allows Alpha to efficiently complete its objective while safely navigating around obstacle B.

Explanation 3:
The decision to survey the area while avoiding obstacle B instead of avoiding obstacle A is based on the prioritization of obstacles. Obstacle B is currently obstructing the vehicle's path and has a very close proximity, which poses a higher risk. Therefore, it is important for Alpha to actively avoid obstacle B to ensure the safe completion of its mission. Obstacle A, on the other hand, does not pose an immediate risk as it is not in the vehicle's path. As a result, Alpha focuses its avoidance efforts on obstacle B rather than obstacle A.

Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle A instead of surveying an area?

Explanation:
The current behavior of alpha is to survey the area while avoiding obstacle B. The decision to avoid obstacle B instead of obstacle A may be due to several reasons:
1) Obstacle B may be considered a higher priority or a more immediate threat compared to obstacle A. It could be larger, closer, or pose a higher risk to the vehicle or its mission.
2) The vehicle's path towards point 3 may be more obstructed by obstacle B, making it necessary to prioritize its avoidance before obstacle A.
3) The vehicle's obstacle avoidance algorithm may prioritize certain types of obstacles based on predefined criteria, such as their size, shape, or potential impact on the mission.

Query 2:
Why is alpha not deploying and surveying with obstacle avoidance instead of being idle with no behavior?

Explanation:
The current state of alpha is idle with no activated behavior. There could be multiple reasons for this choice rather than deploying and surveying with obstacle avoidance:
1) The vehicle may be waiting for further instructions or a command to deploy from C2. It may be required to remain idle until a specific time, a trigger event, or until other vehicles in the area have completed their tasks.
2) There could be operational constraints or limitations preventing the vehicle from immediately deploying, such as limited battery power, ongoing maintenance, or operational restrictions in the area.
3) The mission or task objectives may not require immediate deployment or surveying. Alpha may need to wait for certain conditions or criteria to be met before starting its mission, such as specific weather conditions or a predefined timeline.

Query 3:
Why is alpha not returning to its starting position while avoiding an obstacle instead of surveying the area?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently in the process of surveying an area while avoiding an obstacle. The decision to continue surveying rather than returning to the starting position could be due to the following reasons:
1) The vehicle may have not completed its objective of surveying all the required points before returning. It may be programmed to complete its mission or task before returning, ensuring that sufficient data is collected.
2) The vehicle's current position in the surveying process may provide valuable information or insights that are important to the overall mission. Returning prematurely could result in missing critical data or disrupting the data collection process.
3) There could be other factors or tasks prioritized over returning, such as performing additional measurements, interacting with other vehicles, or assisting with ongoing operations in the area.

- Explanation 1: Alpha's current behavior is prioritizing surveying the area and completing its objective. Avoiding obstacle B might not be the immediate concern if it doesn't hinder the progress towards the objective.
- Explanation 2: Avoiding obstacle A might not be necessary if it doesn't pose a threat to the vehicle or the completion of its objective. The decision-making logic might consider obstacle B to be more critical in the current situation.
- Explanation 3: Alpha might have already assessed the risk posed by obstacle A and determined that it can continue surveying the area while effectively avoiding the obstacle. Therefore, there is no need for a separate behavior to specifically avoid obstacle A.

2) Why is alpha not returning to its starting point instead of surveying the area and avoiding obstacle B?
- Explanation 1: Alpha is currently in the process of surveying the area and completing its objective. Returning to the starting point might not be the most efficient action at the moment.
- Explanation 2: Surveying the area and avoiding obstacle B might have a higher priority for Alpha's objective compared to returning to the starting point. The decision-making logic might consider the information and data gathered during the survey to be more valuable.
- Explanation 3: Alpha might need to gather more information or complete its survey of the area before it deems it necessary to return to the starting point. The behavior of returning might be triggered based on specific conditions or completion of certain tasks.

3) Why is alpha not avoiding both obstacle A and obstacle B instead of only avoiding obstacle B?
- Explanation 1: Alpha's current behavior of avoiding obstacle B might already be sufficient to ensure the vehicle's safety and the completion of its objective. Avoiding both obstacles might not be necessary or might not significantly alter the outcome.
- Explanation 2: The decision-making logic might prioritize avoiding obstacle B over obstacle A due to factors such as proximity, severity of the threat, or the impact on the objective. Avoiding both obstacles simultaneously might not be the optimal course of action.
- Explanation 3: Alpha might have already calculated that it can effectively avoid obstacle B without the need for additional avoidance maneuvers for obstacle A. The decision to avoid only obstacle B might be based on a comprehensive risk assessment and optimization of resources.

4) Why is alpha not idle instead of surveying the area and avoiding obstacle B?
- Explanation 1: Alpha is currently deployed and has an objective to survey the area and possibly avoid obstacles. Remaining idle would not align with its purpose or task.
- Explanation 2: The decision-making logic might prioritize actively gathering data and completing the survey as a more valuable action compared to remaining idle. Idle behavior might be reserved for specific situations or when there is no objective or task assigned to the vehicle.
- Explanation 3: Alpha might have received commands or instructions to actively survey the area and avoid obstacles. Remaining idle would not fulfill those commands or meet the expectations set for the vehicle's behavior.

5) Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle C instead of surveying the area and avoiding obstacle B?
- Explanation 1: Alpha's decision-making logic might prioritize avoiding obstacle B over obstacle C based on factors such as proximity, severity of the threat, or the impact on the objective. Avoiding both obstacles might not be necessary or might not significantly alter the outcome.
- Explanation 2: The avoidance behavior for obstacle B might already take into account the presence of obstacle C or ensure a safe trajectory around both obstacles. Separate avoidance behavior specifically for obstacle C might not be required.
- Explanation 3: Alpha might have already assessed the risk posed by obstacle C and determined that it can safely navigate and complete its survey while avoiding obstacle B. Therefore, there is no need for a separate behavior to specifically avoid obstacle C.

- Explanation 2: The obstacle name is not equal to none, indicating that there is an obstacle present. By continuing with ""waypt_survey"" behavior, the vehicle can survey the area while actively avoiding the obstacle. Switching to ""waypt_return"" behavior may not be suitable if the objective includes collecting data from the current area.
- Explanation 3: The vehicle's heading and next point direction are both northeast, suggesting that it should continue in that direction to reach point 3. Activating ""waypt_return"" behavior would change the vehicle's direction and potentially lead it away from the intended path.

Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle_b instead of surveying the area?

Explanations:
1) Alpha is currently surveying the area while heading towards point 4. The behavior ""waypt_survey"" does not include the action of avoiding obstacles. This behavior assumes that there are no obstacles in the vehicle's path, and the vehicle will continue its objective regardless of the obstacles present.

2) The ""waypt_survey"" behavior focuses on surveying the area and collecting data, rather than avoiding obstacles. This behavior is useful when the priority is to gather information rather than obstacle avoidance. The assumption here is that the vehicle can navigate around the obstacle without altering its behavior.

3) The ""waypt_survey"" behavior is the active behavior because it was selected based on the objective to go through multiple points and survey the area. The obstacle avoidance behavior is not activated because the vehicle is currently prioritizing the surveying objective.

Explanation:
Alpha is currently deployed to survey the area and move towards point 4 with a northeast heading and at a very fast speed. The obstacle ""obstacle_b"" is in close proximity and has not been resolved yet. Since the obstacle is close, Alpha should prioritize avoiding the obstacle before continuing with its objective.

2) Why is alpha not returning to its starting point instead of surveying the area?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently in the process of surveying the area and moving towards point 4 with a northeast heading and at a very fast speed.

Unless the objective is changed or a command is received from C2, Alpha will continue with its current behavior.

3) Why is alpha not avoiding the obstacle and returning to its starting point instead of surveying the area?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently deployed to survey the area and move towards point 4 with a northeast heading and at a very fast speed. While obstacle ""obstacle_b"" is present and in close proximity, the primary objective of Alpha is to survey the area. Returning to the starting point will be considered only after the area is surveyed or if it receives a command to do so.

4) Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle_a and obstacle_e instead of surveying the area?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently surveying the area and moving towards point 4 with a northeast heading and at a very fast speed. Although it encounters both obstacle_a and obstacle_e, it is following the behavior that includes avoiding obstacle_b. The current behavior prioritizes avoiding obstacle_b over the other obstacles.

5) Why is alpha not utilizing any behavior to avoid obstacles instead of surveying the area?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently deployed to survey the area and move towards point 4 with a northeast heading and at a very fast speed. Since there is no obstacle present or the obstacle is not in close proximity, Alpha does not activate any behavior for obstacle avoidance. It will continue with its current surveying behavior until it encounters an obstacle in close proximity.

Explanation:
Alpha is currently deployed to survey the area and is on its way to point 4 with a northeast heading and at a very fast speed. However, it is not returning to its starting point while avoiding obstacle_b, even though it is nearby. This could be because the primary objective is to complete the survey, and returning to the starting point is only necessary once the survey is finished. Additionally, the vehicle might prioritize avoiding the obstacle and continues the survey path while staying clear of the obstacle.

User Query: Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle_b while surveying the area and avoiding obstacle_e?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently surveying the area and is on its way to point 4 with a northeast heading and at a very fast speed. Even though it is avoiding obstacle_e, it is not avoiding obstacle_b, which is also nearby. This could be because the vehicle's decision-making logic only allows it to prioritize one obstacle at a time, and it has determined that avoiding obstacle_e is more critical in the current situation.

- Explanation 1: Alpha is currently in the process of surveying the area and has not detected any obstacles nearby. Therefore, there is no need for it to activate the ""avoid_obstacle"" behavior.
- Explanation 2: Alpha may have already planned its survey path based on the given points, and at the current moment, it does not encounter any obstacles that require avoidance.
- Explanation 3: The obstacle in question, named ""obstacle_b,"" is currently far away from alpha's current position. As a result, alpha does not consider it an immediate threat and does not activate the avoidance behavior.

- Explanation 1: Alpha is currently in the process of surveying the area and has not detected any obstacles nearby. Therefore, there is no need for it to activate the ""avoid_obstacle"" behavior while returning to its starting point.
- Explanation 2: Alpha is programmed to prioritize completing its objective of surveying the area over returning to its starting point. If an obstacle is encountered during the survey, it will activate the avoidance behavior but still continue surveying until its objective is complete.
- Explanation 3: The obstacle named ""obstacle_b"" is currently far away from alpha's current position, and alpha does not consider it an immediate threat. Thus, alpha does not engage in avoidance behavior while returning to its starting point.

3) Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle_a and obstacle_e instead of only avoiding obstacle_b?
- Explanation 1: Alpha's current objective is to survey the area, and it has encountered the obstacle named ""obstacle_b,"" which it is actively avoiding. Alpha may not be programmed to avoid multiple obstacles simultaneously and has prioritized the avoidance of ""obstacle_b"" based on its proximity and threat level.
- Explanation 2: The avoidance behaviors programmed for alpha may be limited to handling a single obstacle at a time. As a result, it only activates the avoidance behavior for the obstacle that poses the most immediate danger, in this case, ""obstacle_b.""
- Explanation 3: The obstacle named ""obstacle_a"" and ""obstacle_e"" may not be detected by alpha's sensors or may not currently pose a significant threat. Therefore, alpha does not engage in avoidance behavior for these obstacles.

Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective, which is to go to points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and then return to the starting position. However, it has encountered an obstacle (obstacle_b) in its path. It should ideally avoid the obstacle and then resume surveying.

Why is alpha not changing its speed to slow when surveying the area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently surveying the area as part of its objective, with a very fast speed. The decision for the speed is likely based on factors such as efficiency, time constraints, or specific requirements for data collection. However, if a slower speed is desirable for more detailed or accurate data collection, it would be a valid alternative behavior for Alpha to change its speed to slow during the survey.

Alpha is currently surveying the area and there is no obstacle present. Therefore, there is no need for it to avoid any obstacle. This behavior allows alpha to focus solely on completing its objective efficiently and without interruption.

3) Why is alpha not avoiding two obstacles while surveying the area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is equipped to avoid obstacles, but there are currently no obstacles present or reported. Therefore, there is no need for it to engage in obstacle avoidance behavior. The absence of obstacles allows alpha to perform its surveying tasks without any additional complexity.

4) Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a while surveying the area?

Explanation: 
Alpha does not need to engage in obstacle avoidance for obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a while surveying the area because there are no obstacles of type obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a present. The current environment does not require that particular type of obstacle avoidance behavior.

5) Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle_avoid_obstacle_c and obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e while surveying the area?

Explanation: 
Alpha does not need to engage in obstacle avoidance for both obstacle_avoid_obstacle_c and obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e while surveying the area because there are no obstacles of type obstacle_avoid_obstacle_c or obstacle_avoid_obstacle_e present. The current environment does not require those specific types of obstacle avoidance behaviors.

Explanation:
The active behavior ""waypt_survey"" is chosen because the vehicle is currently deployed and is in the process of moving towards its objective of reaching point 5. The behavior ""none"" would not allow the vehicle to navigate towards its waypoints and complete its mission. 

2) Why not activate the behavior ""waypt_return"" instead of ""waypt_survey""?
Explanation:
The behavior ""waypt_return"" is not chosen because the vehicle is still in the process of moving towards its waypoints and has not reached its final destination.

- Explanation 1: Alpha is currently prioritizing its objective of moving towards point 5 with a northwest heading and at a very fast speed. Avoiding the obstacle would deviate from this objective and may cause delays in reaching the destination.
- Explanation 2: The obstacle proximity is categorized as ""nearby,"" which implies that the obstacle is not in immediate danger of collision. Therefore, surveying the area may be a more efficient use of time and resources instead of avoiding the obstacle at this moment.
- Explanation 3: Alpha may have the capability to detect and resolve obstacles while surveying the area. By continuing the survey, it can collect valuable data to fulfill its objective and potentially find alternative ways to navigate around or overcome the obstacle.

Modified: waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a

2) Why is alpha not returning to its starting point instead of surveying the area while avoiding the obstacle?
- Explanation 1: Alpha is currently in the middle of its objective of moving towards point 5. Returning to the starting point would mean abandoning the survey and not completing the full objective. Unless there is a specific command or overriding instruction, it is more efficient to continue the survey and avoid the obstacle along the way.
- Explanation 2: The obstacle proximity is categorized as ""nearby,"" suggesting that the obstacle does not pose an immediate threat or obstruction. Given this proximity, surveying the area and avoiding the obstacle while progressing towards point 5 is a reasonable behavior to maintain the flow of the mission.
- Explanation 3: Alpha may have a specific protocol or rule that prioritizes completing the objective before returning to the starting point. This decision could be based on mission requirements, resource optimization, or avoiding unnecessary backtracking.

Behavior Permutation:
Original: waypt_survey
Modified: waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a

3) Why is alpha not using a different behavior combination that includes avoiding both obstacle_a and obstacle_e?
- Explanation 1: The decision-making logic of alpha is currently designed to avoid obstacle_a but not obstacle_e. This behavior combination may have been determined based on the characteristics and threat level of each obstacle. It is possible that obstacle_e is further away or poses a lower risk, so avoiding it may not be necessary for the current objective.
- Explanation 2: Including avoiding both obstacle_a and obstacle_e in the behavior combination may result in a significant deviation from the intended path or objective. Alpha's current behavior combination, which avoids only obstacle_a, may be deemed sufficient for reaching point 5 while minimizing any potential risks.
- Explanation 3: The available behaviors do not include a specific combination that avoids both obstacle_a and obstacle_e. It could be due to limitations in the decision-making logic or the prioritization of other factors, such as efficiency or mission-specific requirements.

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently active in the behavior ""waypt_survey, avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a"", which means it is currently surveying the area while avoiding obstacle_a. The decision to avoid obstacle_a instead of obstacle_b might be based on a prioritization algorithm that considers factors such as obstacle proximity, obstacle size, or obstacle priority. Alternatively, it could be because obstacle_a poses a higher risk or is closer to the vehicle's path compared to obstacle_b.

Why is alpha not avoiding any obstacles instead of avoiding obstacle_a?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently active in the behavior ""waypt_survey, avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a"". The decision to avoid only obstacle_a might be based on the priority or severity of the obstacles. It is possible that obstacle_b, or any other obstacles, do not pose a significant risk or are not within the proximity range that triggers the avoidance behavior.

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently deployed with the objective of surveying points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 while avoiding obstacle A. If Alpha is not avoiding any obstacles, it means that obstacle A has been resolved or is not nearby anymore. Therefore, the vehicle can solely focus on its survey objective without the need for obstacle avoidance.

Why is alpha not avoiding the obstacle using a different behavior?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective, specifically moving towards point 5 with a northeast heading and at a very fast speed. In order to avoid the obstacle named ""obstacle_a"" which is very close, it is currently using the behavior ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a"" which includes obstacle avoidance. This behavior is chosen because it prioritizes completing the objective while avoiding the obstacle. Other behaviors may not prioritize obstacle avoidance or may have different obstacle avoidance strategies that may not be suitable for the current situation.

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently surveying the area and avoiding obstacle_a. The decision to avoid obstacle_a instead of obstacle_b could be due to various reasons. One possible explanation is that the obstacle_a is considered more critical or dangerous compared to obstacle_b. It could be closer to the vehicle or pose a higher risk of collision. Another reason could be that the vehicle's obstacle avoidance algorithm prioritizes obstacle_a over obstacle_b based on predefined rules. Lastly, it is also possible that the vehicle's sensors or perception system detected obstacle_a before obstacle_b, making it the initial obstacle to be avoided.

User Query: Why is alpha not returning to its starting point without avoiding any obstacles?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently deployed to perform its objective, and it is surveying the area while avoiding obstacle_a. The decision not to return to the starting point without avoiding any obstacles could be influenced by safety considerations. The vehicle might have a policy to always avoid obstacles if they are detected, regardless of the objective. This ensures the vehicle operates cautiously and minimizes the risk of collisions or damage. Additionally, by avoiding obstacles, the vehicle can gather more information about the environment and potentially update its map or generate new waypoints for future surveys.

User Query: Why is alpha not returning to its starting point at a slower speed instead of a very fast speed?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently surveying the area and moving towards its next waypoint at a very fast speed. The decision to maintain a very fast speed instead of reducing it could be due to time constraints or operational requirements. The vehicle might be programmed to complete the survey as quickly as possible to meet certain deadlines or operational objectives. Alternatively, the vehicle's performance capabilities and efficiency might be optimized for high-speed operations, allowing it to cover more ground and complete surveys efficiently. Slowing down the speed could result in longer survey times and potentially impact overall mission efficiency.

1) Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle_b instead of obstacle_a?
2) Why is alpha not returning to its starting point instead of surveying an area while avoiding an obstacle?
3) Why is alpha not surveying the area without avoiding any obstacles?

Explanations:
1) The active behavior of alpha is to avoid obstacle_a because it is the closest obstacle and poses a potential risk to the vehicle. If obstacle_a is resolved or its proximity changes, alpha could switch to avoiding obstacle_b instead. However, if obstacle_b is farther away or poses a lower risk, it may not be necessary for alpha to prioritize avoiding it.

2) Alpha is currently deployed and its objective is to go to multiple points before returning to its starting position. By surveying the area while avoiding an obstacle, alpha ensures that it can complete its objective while maintaining safety. If the obstacle is resolved or its proximity changes, alpha could switch to returning to its starting point instead of surveying the area. However, returning immediately may not be efficient if the obstacle is expected to be resolved soon.

3) The active behavior of alpha includes surveying the area without avoiding any obstacles. This behavior is chosen when there are no obstacles nearby or the obstacles have already been resolved. If a new obstacle appears or the proximity of an existing obstacle changes, alpha could switch to avoiding that obstacle while surveying the area. However, if there are no obstacles present, it is not necessary for alpha to switch to avoiding behaviors.

Why is alpha not avoiding obstacle_b instead of just avoiding obstacle_a?

Explanation 1:
Alpha is currently in transit towards point 5 with a northwest heading and at a very fast speed. It is actively avoiding obstacle A, which is in close proximity and located in the southeast direction. Obstacle B may not be a concern at the moment or it may be in a different direction or proximity that does not require immediate avoidance. 

Explanation 2:
Alpha's objective is to reach point 5 and it is actively avoiding the specified obstacle (obstacle A) that is in its path. Depending on the situation, obstacle B might not pose a significant hindrance to the vehicle's progress or it may not have been identified as a potential threat. Therefore, it is not necessary for Alpha to actively avoid obstacle B at this time.

Explanation 3:
The decision-making logic for Alpha prioritizes the avoidance of obstacle A, which is in a very close proximity and poses a direct obstruction on its path. Obstacle B might be located in a different area or its proximity might not be considered a high risk in the current context. Therefore, Alpha is not exhibiting behavior to actively avoid obstacle B.

User Query 2:
Why is alpha not returning to its starting point while avoiding obstacles instead of surveying the area?

Explanation 1:
Although Alpha has encountered obstacles during its surveying task, it is continuing with its objective of reaching point 5. Returning to the starting point while avoiding obstacles might not be the most efficient or immediate action to take, especially if the surveying task has not yet been completed. The priority is to complete the objective, and returning to the starting point can be postponed until obstacles are resolved or the surveying task is finished.

Explanation 2:
Alpha is currently deployed to survey an area and it is actively avoiding obstacle A, which is in very close proximity. Returning to the starting point is not the active behavior because the surveying task has not yet been accomplished. Alpha will only return to the starting point once the surveying task is completed, or if it receives a specific command from C2.

Explanation 3:
The primary objective of Alpha is to survey the area and it is actively avoiding obstacle A while doing so. Returning to the starting point before the area has been adequately surveyed would interrupt the progress of data gathering. It is more efficient for Alpha to continue with the surveying task while avoiding obstacles until its objective is fulfilled.

User Query 3:
Why is alpha not returning to its starting point while avoiding obstacles instead of surveying the area and avoiding obstacles A and E?

Explanation 1:
Alpha is currently deployed to survey an area and is actively avoiding obstacles A and E, which are in close proximity. Returning to the starting point immediately would interrupt the ongoing surveying task and interrupt the gathering of valuable data points. Alpha will only return to the starting point once both the survey and obstacle avoidance tasks are completed, or if it receives a specific command from C2.

Explanation 2:
The current active behavior of Alpha includes surveying the area and avoiding obstacles A and E. This combination of behaviors allows Alpha to collect essential data while ensuring that it navigates around the identified obstacles. Returning to the starting point before completing the survey while avoiding the obstacles may result in incomplete data collection.

Explanation 3:
Alpha's primary objective is to survey the area, and it is currently avoiding obstacles A and E while doing so. The decision-making logic prioritizes data gathering over returning to the starting point. Once the survey is completed and obstacles A and E are resolved, Alpha will execute the behavior to return to its starting point.

Why is alpha surveying the area while avoiding obstacle A instead of just surveying the area?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently surveying the area while simultaneously avoiding obstacle A. This behavior is activated because there is an obstacle nearby (close proximity) named obstacle A, and it has not been resolved yet. By avoiding the obstacle, alpha ensures the safety and smooth progression of its survey mission.

Potential Alternatives: 
1) Alpha could continue surveying the area without avoiding obstacle A if it is deemed safe to do so. This alternative behavior assumes that obstacle A poses no immediate threat or interference to the survey mission. 
2) Alpha could temporarily halt the survey and resolve obstacle A before resuming its survey mission. By resolving the obstacle, alpha can ensure the completeness and accuracy of its survey data without compromising safety. 
3) Alpha could choose a different path or adjust its heading to avoid obstacle A while surveying the area. Instead of completely avoiding the obstacle, alpha could navigate around it to minimize disruption to the survey mission.

Why is alpha not avoiding the obstacle instead of surveying the area?

Explanations:
1) Alpha is currently surveying the area to complete its objective of reaching point 5 before returning to the starting position. The obstacle proximity is close, which means it is not in immediate danger. Therefore, there is no need for alpha to prioritize avoiding the obstacle at this moment.
2) The obstacle direction is southeast, while alpha is currently heading northwest. Since the obstacle is not directly in the path of alpha's movement, there is no immediate need for alpha to change its behavior and avoid the obstacle.
3) Alpha is equipped with the behavior ""waypt_survey"" which focuses on completing the surveying objective. Avoiding obstacles is not the primary behavior for alpha, unless the obstacle proximity becomes dangerous or obstructs the path to the next point.

Why is alpha not surveying an area instead of being idle?

Explanation 1: 
Alpha is currently in a completed state, meaning it has finished its objective and is not currently tasked with any specific behavior. It is idle because there is no need for it to perform any actions at the moment. 

Explanation 2:
Surveying an area requires a specific objective, such as going to points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Since alpha has already completed its objective and is now returning to its starting position, it does not need to survey an area.

Why is alpha not avoiding the obstacle 'obstacle_a' instead of returning to its starting point?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently in the behavior of returning to its starting point. This behavior is activated because the 'return' value is set to True. The obstacle 'obstacle_a' is currently far away and has not been resolved yet. Since the proximity of the obstacle is not 'nearby', 'close', or 'very close', the behavior of avoiding the obstacle is not activated. Alpha is prioritizing returning to its starting point over obstacle avoidance.

Potential Alternatives:
1) If the objective allows, Alpha could avoid the obstacle 'obstacle_a' and then continue to its starting point.
2) Alpha could prioritize obstacle avoidance over returning to its starting point, even if the obstacle is far away.
3) Alpha could wait for the obstacle 'obstacle_a' to be resolved before continuing to its starting point.

Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding obstacle A instead of returning to its starting point?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently in the return phase and its objective is to return to its starting point. The obstacle A is marked as ""far"" and has not been resolved yet. In this scenario, the priority is to return to the starting point rather than surveying the area and avoiding the obstacle. The vehicle will only deviate from its return path if the obstacle comes closer and poses a threat.

Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding obstacle A instead of returning to its starting point?

Explanation: 
Alpha is currently in the return stage and is heading towards its starting point with a northwest direction and at maximum speed. The reason it is not surveying the area while avoiding obstacle A is that its objective is to return to the starting point. The vehicle prioritizes reaching its destination and resolving any obstacles along the way. 

Potential Alternatives for Active Behavior:
1) If obstacle proximity is nearby or close, alpha could switch to the behavior ""waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a"" to simultaneously survey the area and avoid obstacle A.
2) If the obstacle is resolved, alpha could switch to the behavior ""waypt_survey"" to continue surveying the area without any obstacle constraints.
3) If the obstacle proximity is too close and cannot be avoided, alpha could switch to the behavior ""none"" and stop its movement until the obstacle is resolved.

Explanation:
Alpha is currently in the return stage and has already completed its objective to go to points 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. It is now returning to its starting point, and there is no need for it to survey the area or avoid obstacle A. Additionally, the obstacle proximity is very far, which means it is not close enough to warrant surveying or avoiding actions.

2) Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding obstacle B instead of returning to its starting point?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently in the return stage and its objective is to return to its starting point. There is no need for it to survey the area or avoid obstacle B as it has already completed its objective. Additionally, the obstacle proximity is not specified, so it is assumed that there is no obstacle nearby that requires avoidance.

3) Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding obstacles C and E instead of returning to its starting point?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently in the return stage and its objective is to return to its starting point. There is no need for it to survey the area or avoid obstacles C and E as it has already completed its objective. It should focus on returning to the starting point rather than diverting to survey or avoid additional obstacles.

- Explanation 1: Alpha has completed its objective of reaching all the waypoints and is now returning to the starting point as instructed. There is no need for it to continue surveying the area.
- Explanation 2: The obstacle has been resolved and there is no need for alpha to continue surveying the area. Returning to the starting point completes its mission.
- Explanation 3: Alpha has already finished surveying the area in a previous behavior stage and is now in the process of returning to the starting point as part of its objective.

2) Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding obstacles A and B instead of returning to its starting point?
- Explanation 1: Alpha is currently returning to its starting point as instructed and there are no specific instructions to survey the area while avoiding obstacles A and B. The focus is on returning, not surveying.
- Explanation 2: Alpha has already completed the surveying and obstacle avoidance tasks in a previous behavior stage. It is now in the stage of returning to the starting point. There is no need to repeat the same tasks.
- Explanation 3: The instructions for alpha at this stage prioritize returning to the starting point over surveying and obstacle avoidance. It is following the given priority and executing the appropriate behavior.

3) Why is alpha not surveying the area while avoiding obstacle E instead of returning to its starting point?
- Explanation 1: Alpha is currently following the instruction to return to its starting point. The priority at this stage is returning, not surveying or avoiding obstacle E.
- Explanation 2: There is no requirement or instruction for alpha to survey the area while avoiding obstacle E. Its current objective is to return to the starting point, and it is executing the corresponding behavior.
- Explanation 3: Alpha has already completed the surveying and obstacle avoidance tasks in previous stages. The current objective only focuses on returning to the starting point, and there is no need for additional behaviors.

Explanation:
Alpha is currently in the return stage of its behavior and its objective is to return to its starting point. The vehicle has completed its surveying tasks and now needs to return to the starting point. Surveying the area would be unnecessary and inefficient at this stage.

2) Why is alpha not avoiding obstacles while returning to its starting point?

Explanation:
Alpha is in the return stage of its behavior and its objective is to return to its starting point. At this stage, the vehicle does not need to prioritize avoiding obstacles since it is already on its way back. The focus is on efficiently returning to the starting point rather than avoiding obstacles.

3) Why is alpha not surveying the area and avoiding obstacles A and B instead of returning to its starting point?

Explanation:
Alpha is currently in the return stage of its behavior and its objective is to return to its starting point. Surveying the area and avoiding obstacles A and B would divert the vehicle from its primary objective and delay the return to the starting point.

4) Why is beta not deployed to survey an area?

Explanation:
Beta's deploy parameter is currently set to False, indicating that the vehicle is not deployed to perform any task or objective at the moment. This decision could be due to various reasons, such as not having received a deployment command from the control center or being assigned to other tasks.

5) Why is beta not avoiding obstacle A while in transit?

Explanation:
Beta's active behavior does not include the avoidance of obstacles. It is currently in transit towards point 0, and its primary objective is to reach the destination efficiently. Since avoiding obstacles is not a part of its assigned behavior, it will not actively engage in obstacle avoidance unless a different behavior is activated.

6) Why is beta not returning to its starting point instead of going to point 0?

Explanation:
Beta's next point is set to point 0, indicating that it has a specific objective or task to reach that location. The decision to go to point 0 instead of returning to the starting point could be based on instructions from the control center or the need to perform a specific task at point 0 before returning to the starting point.

7) Why is gamma not avoiding obstacle B while surveying the area?

Explanation:
Currently, gamma is in the surveying stage and its objective is to survey the area. It does not have obstacle avoidance as part of its active behavior. The focus is on completing the surveying task rather than prioritizing obstacle avoidance. 

8) Why is gamma not returning to its starting point instead of continuing to point 2?

Explanation:
Gamma's next point is set to point 2, indicating that it has not completed its surveying tasks and there are still points that need to be covered. Returning to the starting point at this stage would interrupt the surveying process and result in an incomplete task. It will return to the starting point once it has surveyed all the designated points.

9) Why is gamma not deploying to survey an area while avoiding obstacles C and E?

Explanation:
Gamma's active behavior includes surveying the area but does not involve avoiding obstacles C and E. The decision to exclude these specific obstacles from avoidance could be due to various reasons, such as the obstacles being non-threatening or already resolved. The active behavior is designed to prioritize the surveying task without the need for obstacle avoidance for certain obstacles.
