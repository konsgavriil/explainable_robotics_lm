{"text": "### Instruction: Below is a why-not query that asks for an explanation and a behaviour permutation based on the provided vehicle state representation. User query: Why not Maxdepth,loiter,bhv_const_depth instead of Maxdepth,bhv_const_depth,waypt_survey?, Representation: {'objectives': 'Loiter between points 0 to 7 until a survey objective is provided, then perform the survey and finally return back to starting point', 'deploy': 'True', 'return': 'False', 'next_waypoint': 'point0', 'behaviour_stage': 'advanced', 'next_loiter_point': 'none', 'gps_update_received': 'False', 'depth': 'very deep', 'vehicle_at_surface': 'False', 'periodic_ascend': 'True', 'waypoint_direction': 'southwest', 'loiter_point_direction': 'none', 'speed': 'very fast', 'heading': 'southwest', 'name': 'henry', 'active_behaviour': 'maxdepth,bhv_const_depth,waypt_survey'}, ### Response: Explanation: In the current behavior, Henry is set to perform a survey in a designated area. However, the user's query suggests that instead of performing a survey, Henry should loiter between points 0 to 7. This could be to await further instructions or to gather more information before proceeding with the survey. Additionally, by incorporating the Maxdepth and bhv_const_depth behaviors, Henry will maintain a constant depth during the loitering phase., Behaviour Permutation: \nOriginal: 'Maxdepth,bhv_const_depth,waypt_survey'\nModified: 'Maxdepth,loiter,bhv_const_depth'"}
