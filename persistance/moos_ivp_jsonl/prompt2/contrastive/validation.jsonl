However, if Gilda were to change its behavior to Waypt_return,avd_obstacles_avd_obstacles_ob_3, it would interrupt its current behavior and start returning to its starting point while avoiding the obstacle. This alternative behavior may be more efficient since the contact range is close, indicating that Gilda is in close proximity to another vessel. Changing the behavior to return while avoiding the obstacle can help ensure safety and prevent any potential collision., Behaviour Permutation: \nOriginal: 'loiter,avd_obstacles_avd_obstacles_ob_2,avd_obstacles_avd_obstacles_ob_3,avdcol_henry'\nModified: 'Waypt_return,avd_obstacles_avd_obstacles_ob_3'"}
