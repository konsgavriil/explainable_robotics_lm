1
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Henry and Gilda are moving to their next waypoint to loiter around, because they were deployed by command and control.

2
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Henry and Gilda have been asked by command and control to exchange sides and then loiter again.

3
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Henry has encountered an obstacle on it's right side, but because there is medium proximity, the vessel is maintaining its heading.

4
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.200
Gilda has encountered an obstacle on its left side in close proximity. As a result, it needs to make a right turn to move around it.

5
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Henry and Gilda have reached their waypoints and are loitering around. 

6
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.000
Henry and Gilda have reached the time threshold they are allowed to loiter in the same area and exchange sides. 

7
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.500
Henry and Gilda have spotted an obstacle and need to move around it.

8
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Henry and Gilda have spotted new obstacle, but because they are not in close proximity, avoidance is not necessary.

9
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.500
Command and control requested both vessels to exchange loiter areas.

10
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Both vessels encounter an obstacle and need to move around it.

11
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Both vessels had to avoid collision with each other. Henry is waiting for gilda to pass and then continues its course.

12
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Both vessels are now moving towards their loiter waypoints.
