1
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Henry and Gilda are moving to their next waypoint to loiter around, because they were deployed by command and control.

2
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.000
Henry and Gilda have reached the time threshold they are allowed to loiter in the same area and exchange sides. 

3
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Both vessels are actively maneuvering to avoid a head-on collision. Gilda maintains its course at a reduced speed, while Henry alters its trajectory to move away from the impending collision.

4
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.000
Henry has spotted an obstacle on its right side, but there is no need to modify its trajectory.

5
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Henry and Gilda have been asked by command and control to exchange sides and then loiter again.

6
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.300
Henry and Gilda are actively maneuvering to avoid a head-on collision. Gilda doesn't reduce its speed on time and even though Henry alters its trajectory, there's a minor collision.

7
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Henry and Gilda have been asked by command and control to return to their starting point.
