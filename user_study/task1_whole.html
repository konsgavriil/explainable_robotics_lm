            <div class="panel-body" id="instructionBody"> In this user study, you are going to assume the role of an
                operator who is in charge of supervising an autonomous maritime robot. This means that you are in charge
                of overseeing the mission and ensuring that the integrity of the robot is not compromised. <br> <br>
                <img src="https://zenodo.org/records/11153372/files/c2_b.jpeg" alt="Command and Control" class="center"> <br><br>
                About the task itself, you are going to watch videos of robots that perform various tasks in a maritime
                domain. At random timesteps, you might be asked a question about the mission and you will need to select
                one of the available answers. If you are not sure about the answer, then you can use the hint button to
                get some help. Try answering without any help if you are certain about the answer, otherwise, use the
                hint to avoid doing wrong choices. <br> <br>
