            <div class="panel-body" id="instructionBody"> In this user study, you are going to assume the role of an operator who is in charge of supervising an autonomous maritime robot. This means that you are in charge of overseeing the mission and ensuring that the integrity of the robot is not compromised. <br> <br>
            	 <img src="https://zenodo.org/records/11153372/files/c2_b.jpeg" alt="Command and Control" class="center"> <br><br>            
                Regarding the task, you will be watching videos of robots performing various tasks in a maritime environment. At random
                intervals, you will be asked questions about the mission and will need to choose one of the provided answers.
                Occasionally, explanations will appear in different formats to give you more insight into the robots' behaviors. Pay
                close attention to both the robots' actions and the explanations to effectively answer the questions. <br> <br>
                Let the user study begin!
