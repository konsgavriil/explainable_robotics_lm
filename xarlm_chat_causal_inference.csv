Alpha has activated the waypoint survey behaviour because it is currently in transit between two points and needs to navigate through unfamiliar waters to reach its next destination. By surveying potential obstacles along its route, Alpha can better plan its course and avoid any hazards that may be present. Additionally, the absence of any obstacle resolution suggests that Alpha has not yet encountered any significant challenges on its path.","Alpha is currently conducting a waypoint survey and moving towards point 1 with maximum speed in the southeast direction. Since there are no obstacles nearby and the objective is to visit multiple points before returning to the starting position, the vehicle continues its course without any deviation."
