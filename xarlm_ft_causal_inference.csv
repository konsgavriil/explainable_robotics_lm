Why has Alpha activated this specific behaviour?,"{'objective': 'Go to points 0, 1, 2, 3 and then return to starting position.', 'deploy': 'True', 'return': 'False', 'obstacle_name': 'obstacle_a', 'obstacle_proximity': 'nearby', 'obstacle_resolved': 'False', 'behaviour_stage': 'in-transit', 'next_point': 'point3', 'speed': 'very fast', 'heading': 'northwest', 'next_point_direction': 'northwest', 'obstacle_direction': 'northwest', 'name': 'alpha', 'active_behaviour': 'waypt_survey,avoid_obstacle_avoid_obstacle_a'}"," Alpha is currently doing a survey moving towards point 3 while avoiding obstacle A nearby. Even though it's heading northwest with a very fast speed, its next point direction remains unchanged as alpha continues its course without any obstacles in sight. Therefore, there are no changes or adjustments needed for behavior at this stage.
---
#### Explanation: The active behavior indicates that waypoints survey mode is enabled alongside obstacle avoidance which means alpha is actively trying to move away from obstacle A but still maintaining its objective of reaching point 3 eventually. As long as there aren’t any other obstructions present, alpha will continue on its path until completion without altering its trajectory significantly due to environmental factors such as wind currents etc., resulting in smooth sailing throughout the entire journey even if they encounter unexpected challenges along their route!","Alpha is currently doing a survey and moving towards point 3. Even though obstacle A is nearby and has not been resolved, the vehicle continues its course moving very fast with a northwest heading, while also actively avoiding obstacle A."
Why has Gilda activated this specific behaviour?,"{'objective': 'Loiter around in different areas which are selected randomly, while avoiding obstacles and collision with other vessels.

There was another nearby obstacle but it wasn't close enough for contact resolution so there hasn’t been any need to change course or speed up/slow down yet as per collision-avoidance mode set at “none”. Additionally, since Gilda isn’t returning back after completing its objective, we can infer that active behavior will continue until new loiter area is specified or if collision happens between multiple objects then emergency stop would be initiated accordingly based on configured settings within AI controller software package installed aboard vessel before launch into sea environment without human intervention required anymore!"," Gilda is currently loitering fast towards point 3 with a southeast heading while avoiding obstacle 2. There is a close contact range with the obstacle, but the contact has not been resolved yet."

As such, it continues its course at a high speed with a southwest turning behavior to prevent any potential collision. Additionally, alpha maintains its objective of visiting all waypoints before returning back to the initial location.","Alpha is currently performing a waypoint survey and avoiding obstacle C, which is very close.

Why has Henry activated this specific behaviour?,"{'objectives': 'Loiter between points 0 to 7 until a survey objective is provided, then perform the survey and finally return back to starting point', 'deploy': 'True', 'return': 'False', 'next_waypoint': 'point1', 'behaviour_stage': 'advanced', 'next_loiter_point': 'none', 'gps_update_received': 'False', 'depth': 'very deep', 'vehicle_at_surface': 'False', 'periodic_ascend': 'True', 'waypoint_direction': 'southwest', 'loiter_point_direction': 'none', 'speed': 'max speed', 'heading': 'southwest', 'name': 'henry', 'active_behaviour': 'maxdepth,bhv_const_depth,waypt_survey'}"," Henry is currently en route towards point 1 in the southwest while maintaining maximum depth. It also periodically ascends as per its configured behavior but does not receive any GPS update at the moment. As a result, it continues moving very fast with a southwest heading. However, if there was an obstacle ahead or another vessel nearby, Henry would need to change course accordingly before reaching point 1.
#### Explanation: The active behaviors are influenced by several factors such as mission objectives (e.g., loiter between points), environmental conditions (e.g., depth, sea currents), communication capabilities (e.g., GPS updates) and other external influences (e.g., presence of obstacles). In this case, even though Henry is moving swiftly toward its next waypoint, it needs to be cautious about potential threats along the path so that it can successfully complete its task without incurring damage or causing harm","Henry is in the advanced stage and is currently loitering between points 0 to 7, waiting for a survey objective to be provided. The vehicle is at a very deep depth and is not at the surface, indicating that it is conducting operations underwater. The vehicle is also set to periodically ascend, ensuring it stays within the approved depth range."

Additionally, since alpha does not need to change direction due to obstacles present at different angles compared to other vehicles on mission planning routes during waypoints surveying tasks before reaching their final destination. As such, alpha continues efficiently collecting valuable insights into various environments even when encountering potential hazards along the route ensuring successful completion within time constraints set by stakeholders/managers who have approved these missions previously based on thorough risk assessments conducted priorhand through proper analysis techniques employed earlier during mission design stage itself where risks were identified accordingly so they could be mitigated properly before execution began resulting ultimately safe outcome achieved overall!","Alpha is currently in the advanced stage of its survey, moving towards point 3 at maximum speed with an east heading.

#### Explanation: The active behavior of alpha is influenced by multiple factors such as objective, deploy status (true), return mode (also true) and other environmental conditions like distance from obstacle A which remains outside the influence zone even though its direction is southeast. As a result, alpha can continue moving forward confidently without having to worry about potential hazards along its path.
